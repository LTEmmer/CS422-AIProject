# Blender-Python-Procedural-Level-Generation
Collection of scripts for generating 3D levels (environments/dungeons) procedurally. Leverages Blender's Python API. Currently a work in progress.

## Instructions to run
1. Open a new instance of the Blender program
2. Navigate to the **scripting** screen https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/window_system/screens.html
3. Import the script via the *Open* button or click the *New* button and paste the contents of a script into the script editor
4. Click the *Run Script* button

For an introduction to Blender scripting with Python
https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/scripting/introduction.html

## Special notes about versioning
The scripts in 2.7 will not work in 2.8 but the scripts in 2.8 continue to work in 2.9+
If at some point in the future breaking API changes are introduced a new folder will be added for the scripts to be ported
