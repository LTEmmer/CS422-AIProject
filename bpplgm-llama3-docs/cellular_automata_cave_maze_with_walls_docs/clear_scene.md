# clear_scene

    Purpose

    The function `clear_scene` is used to clean up an object by switching its mode to 'OBJECT', selecting all objects in the scene, and then deleting them.

```python
def clear_scene():
    """
    Clean up an object by switching its mode to 'OBJECT', 
    selecting all objects in the scene, and then deleting them.
    
    This function is used to reset a 3D model's state to its original 
    default settings, typically after it has been modified or 
    customized. It can be useful for saving work before editing 
    further.

    Parameters:
    None

    Returns:
    None
    """
    if bpy.ops.object.mode_set.poll():
        bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')
        bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')
        bpy.ops.object.delete(use_global=False)
```
    Parameters

    Here is the documented code:

    if bpy.ops.object.mode_set.poll():
        # Mode is polled to check if the object's mode is set to 'OBJECT'
        # Polling this mode ensures that it is checked before attempting 
        # to switch to 'OBJECT', which would raise an error if not in that state
        
        # The object's mode is switched to 'OBJECT'
        bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')

        bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')

        bpy.ops.object.delete(use_global=False)
```
    Returns

    # Return type: None
    # Description: The function does not return any value explicitly.
    # Special cases:
    # - If the object is already in 'OBJECT' mode, no changes are made.
    # - If there are no objects selected in the scene, nothing happens.

    ```python
# Basic usage
def clear_scene():
    """Clears the scene by resetting all variables to their initial values."""
    # Explanation
    # This function resets all variables in the scene to their initial state.
    # It is typically used at the beginning of a script or method to ensure consistency and prevent side effects.
    global scene_data  # Access the global scope to modify the scene data
    for variable, value in scene_data.items():
        setattr(variable, '', '')  # Reset all attributes with an empty string

# Edge case: Empty dictionary
def clear_scene_empty_dict():
    """Clears a scene by resetting all variables in a dictionary."""
    # Explanation
    # This function resets all variables in the scene by clearing any dictionaries or lists associated with those variables.
    global scene_data  # Access the global scope to modify the scene data
    for key, value in scene_data.items():
        if isinstance(value, dict):
            clear_scene_empty_dict(value)

# Edge case: List of tuples
def clear_scene_list_of_tuples():
    """Clears a scene by resetting all variables in a list of tuples."""
    # Explanation
    # This function resets all variables in the scene by clearing any lists or dictionaries associated with those variables.
    global scene_data  # Access the global scope to modify the scene data
    for index, value in enumerate(scene_data):
        if isinstance(value, tuple) and len(value) == 3:
            scene_data[index] = (0, '', '')  # Reset all attributes with an empty string

# Advanced scenario: If applicable
def clear_scene_with_attributes():
    """Clears a scene by resetting all variables in the scene."""
    # Explanation
    # This function resets all variables in the scene by clearing any dictionaries or lists associated with those variables.
    global scene_data  # Access the global scope to modify the scene data
    for attribute, value in scene_data.items():
        setattr(attribute, '', '')  # Reset all attributes with an empty string

# Usage example: Clearing a scene with some initial values
scene_data = {
    'x': 10,
    'y': 20,
    'color': ('red',),
    'size': (30,)
