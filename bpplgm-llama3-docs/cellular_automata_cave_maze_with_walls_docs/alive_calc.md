# alive_calc

    Purpose

    This function determines whether an object is considered 'alive' by randomly selecting a value from 0 to 1. If the selected value is less than a specified chance (CHANCE_TO_START_ALIVE), the object is assumed to be alive, and it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

```python
def alive_calc():
    if random() < CHANCE_TO_START_ALIVE:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

Examples:

```python
print(alive_calc())  # Returns True with a probability of 0.5 (50%)
print(alive_calc())  # Returns False with a probability of 1 (33.3%)
```
    Parameters

    ```python
def alive_calc(
    # No parameters are required for this function
):

    Returns

    # Return type: bool (True or False)
    
    # Description:
    # This function uses randomness to decide whether an object is considered alive.
    # If a value less than the specified chance (0.5 in this case) is randomly selected,
    # the object is assumed to be alive, and it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

    # Special cases:
    # The return type indicates that there are two possible outcomes: True or False.
    # The function uses a random boolean value to make these decisions, which ensures randomness.
    # No specific conditions or thresholds are provided in the code; instead, the outcome is determined randomly.
