    Purpose

    """
    This function checks all possible neighbor positions of a given position and attempts to place a cube at each valid position.

    Parameters:
    pos (tuple): The current position to be checked for neighbors.

    # Define an offset map for the walls, which includes 4 possible directions (up, down, left, right) with corresponding offsets

                  (pos[0] + 2.0, pos[1]),
                  (pos[0], pos[1] - 2.0),
                  (pos[0], pos[1] + 2.0)]
    
    # Iterate over each offset tuple in the offset map

```
    Parameters

    ## Function: `check_neighbors_and_place_wall`
### Parameters

*   `pos`: The current position to be checked for neighbors.

### Purpose
This function checks all possible neighbor positions of a given position and attempts to place a cube at each valid position. It utilizes an offset map to determine the potential positions where cubes can be placed while adhering to the boundaries defined by walls.

### Examples

    ```python
>>> check_neighbors_and_place_wall((0, 0))
```

    This function does not return any values; its primary purpose is to perform specified actions for given input positions.
    Returns

    ```python
def check_neighbors_and_place_wall(pos):
    """
    This function checks all possible neighbor positions of a given position and attempts to place a cube at each valid position.

    Parameters:
    pos (tuple): The current position to be checked for neighbors.
    
    Returns:
        list: A list of tuples representing the coordinates of wall positions that can potentially contain cubes after their placement attempt.

    offset_map = [(pos[0] - 2.0, pos[1]),
                  (pos[0] + 2.0, pos[1]),
                  (pos[0], pos[1] - 2.0),
                  (pos[0], pos[1] + 2.0)]
    
    # Iterate over each offset tuple in the offset map
    for offset_tuple in offset_map:
        # Check if the current offset tuple has not been visited before and is still within the walls
        if offset_tuple not in visited and offset_map not in walls:
            # Attempt to place a cube at the current position by calling the function `place_cube` with the offset tuple coordinates as arguments
            place_cube(offset_tuple[0], offset_tuple[1])
            
            # Add the current offset tuple coordinate to the set of wall positions for future reference
            walls.append((offset_tuple[0], offset_tuple[1]))
    
    # Return an empty list if no valid neighbor positions were found (this is a special case)
    return []
```

**Return type:** list (a list of tuples representing wall positions)

**Description:** An empty list is returned when there are no valid neighbor positions for the given position.

**Special cases:**

* If `visited` or `walls` are not defined, an empty list is returned. This indicates that the function was unable to find any valid neighbors or walls to place a cube at.
```python
return []
```
Note: In this special case, it's assumed that `visited` and `walls` are sets or lists of tuples representing wall positions.
