# initialize_map

    Purpose

    The `initialize_map` function creates an 2D list representation of a grid, where each cell can be either alive or dead (represented by 'A' and 'D' respectively). The outer list represents the rows, while the inner lists represent the columns.

```python
def initialize_map():
    """
    Creates an initial map with a size determined by WIDTH and HEIGHT.
    
    Returns:
        A 2D list where each cell is either alive ('A') or dead ('D').
    """
    initial_map = [[alive_calc() for _ in range(WIDTH)] for _ in range(HEIGHT)]
    return initial_map
```
    Parameters

    Here is the documented function:

```python
def initialize_map():
    """
    Creates an initial map with a size determined by WIDTH and HEIGHT.

    Returns:
        A 2D list where each cell is either alive ('A') or dead ('D').

    Parameters:
    - None (no parameters are accepted)

    Usage Constraints:
    - The function does not accept any input parameters.
    - It returns a 2D list, which can be used as the initial map for the game.

    Notes:
    - The size of the initial map is determined by WIDTH and HEIGHT, which are expected to be integers.

    initial_map = [[alive_calc() for _ in range(WIDTH)] for _ in range(HEIGHT)]
    return initial_map
```
    Returns

    ```python

    Initializes an empty map.

# Advanced scenario (if applicable)

    """
    Initializes a map with multiple keys and values.
