# cleanup_mesh

    Purpose

    ```python
def cleanup_mesh():
    """
    Cleans up a 3D mesh by joining separate cube objects, removing overlapping vertices,
    and toggling the object's editing mode.

    It performs the following steps:
        1. Selects all cube objects.
        2. Joins all selected cube objects into one object.
        3. Toggles the object's editing mode to edit the mesh.
        4. Selects all vertices in the edited mesh.
        5. Removes overlapping vertices from the mesh.
        6. Toggles the object's editing mode again to exit editing mode.

    Returns: None

    Returns

    ### cleanup_mesh Function

#### Return Value

The `cleanup_mesh` function returns `None`.

#### Description

The `cleanup_mesh` function cleans up a 3D mesh by joining separate cube objects, removing overlapping vertices, and toggling the object's editing mode.

#### Special Cases

- The function only accepts an empty list as its return statement. This indicates that no data is being returned to the caller.
