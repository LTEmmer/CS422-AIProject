# point_collide

    Purpose

    ```python
def point_collide(self, x, y):  # Represents whether a point on the map collides with another point
    """
    Checks if two points on the same line (but not on the same edge of the map) collide.

    Args:
        x (int): The column index of the first point.
        y (int): The row index of the first point.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the points collides, False otherwise.
    """
```
    Parameters

    ```python
def point_collide(self, x, y):
    """
    Checks if two points on the same line (but not on the same edge of the map) collide.

    Args:
        x (int): The column index of the first point.
        y (int): The row index of the first point.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the points collide, False otherwise.

- `self`: The 'self' parameter represents an object reference to the current instance. It is used as a placeholder for the self argument in method calls that expect another method or function call as an argument. In this case, it's likely used to access variables and methods from the same class.

- `x (int)`: The column index of the first point.
    - Type: `int`
    - Description: This parameter represents the row index of the first point on a 2D line map.

- `y (int)`: The row index of the first point.
    - Type: `int`
    - Description: This parameter represents the column index of the second point on a 2D line map.
    Returns

    ```python
def point_collide(self, x, y):  # Represents whether a point on the map collides with another point
    """
    Checks if two points on the same line (but not on the same edge of the map) collide.

    Args:
        x (int): The column index of the first point.
        y (int): The row index of the first point.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the points collides, False otherwise.

    Examples:
        >>> point_collide(0, 1)
        False
        >>> point_collide(1, 2)
        True
```
Return type: `bool`

Description: This function checks whether two points on the same line (but not on the same edge of the map) collide. It returns `True` if the points do collide and `False` otherwise.

Special cases:

- If both points have the same x-coordinate, they are considered to be colliding.
- If both points have the same y-coordinate, they are also considered to be colliding.
    Examples

    ```python
def point_collide(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    """
    Check if two points are colliding.

    Args:
        x1 (float): The x-coordinate of the first point.
        y1 (float): The y-coordinate of the first point.
        x2 (float): The x-coordinate of the second point.
        y2 (float): The y-coordinate of the second point.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the points are colliding, False otherwise.
