# mark_start_and_end

    Purpose

    This function appears to be part of a class, likely used in a game or simulation, where it marks specific points on the map (start and end positions) with a unique identifier ('t') for tracking purposes. 

- The purpose is to define these start and end points as separate locations on the map.
- The identifiers assigned to these points are 3 and 4 respectively, indicating that they should be visited or explored at different times in some way.
    Parameters

    ```
def mark_start_and_end(self, start_point: tuple, end_point: tuple) -> None:
    """
    Marks specific points on the map (start and end positions) with a unique identifier ('t') for tracking purposes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    start_point : tuple
        The coordinates of the start point as a tuple of two integers.
    end_point : tuple
        The coordinates of the end point as a tuple of two integers.

    Usage Constraints
    -------------
    None

    Notes
    -----
    This function assigns identifiers 't' to the start and end points respectively, which should be used to track their positions in some way.

    ### mark_start_and_end

```python
def mark_start_and_end(coordinates: list) -> dict:
    """
    Marks specific points on a map (start and end positions) with unique identifiers.

    Args:
        coordinates (list): A list of tuples representing the start and end positions.
            Each tuple contains two integers, representing the x and y coordinates respectively.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the starting position as key and its identifier ('t') as value.

    Description:
        This function marks specific points on a map with unique identifiers. It defines these start and end points
        as separate locations on the map by assigning them the identifiers 3 and 4 respectively.
        
        The purpose of this function is to define these start and end points as separate locations on the map, where
        they should be visited or explored at different times in some way.

    Special cases:
        If no coordinates are provided, an empty list will be returned. 
        If a coordinate tuple contains less than two integers (e.g., x=1, y=2), it will be ignored.
        """
```

### Example usage:

```python
coordinates = [(0, 0), (3, 4)]  # (start point)
result = mark_start_and_end(coordinates)  # {'t': '3'}
print(result)  # {'t': '3'}

# Example with non-existent coordinates:
coordinates = [(5, 6)]  # This will be ignored

# Example with invalid coordinates (not two integers):
coordinates = [(0, 'a')]  # This will raise a ValueError
```
    Examples

def mark_start_and_end(text, start_marker):
    """
    Marks all occurrences of a given start marker in a text.

    Args:
        text (str): The input text to search for markers.
        start_marker (str): The start marker to be searched for.

    Returns:
