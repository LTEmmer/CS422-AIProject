# find_closest

    Purpose

    **Purpose**
The `find_closest` method is designed to find the room in a list of rooms where all other rooms have a closer distance from the input room.

*   It calculates the average position of each compared room relative to the master room.
*   If multiple rooms are found with the same minimum distance, it returns one of them arbitrarily.
    Parameters

    ```python
def find_closest(self, room: Room, others=None) -> Room:
    """
    Finds the closest room to the input room in a list of rooms.

    The function calculates the average position of each compared room relative to the master room.
    If multiple rooms are found with the same minimum distance, it returns one of them arbitrarily.

    Parameters
    ----------
    self : None or Room
        The current room being processed (can be either 'self' if this method is called on an instance of a class that has been passed in as its first argument).
    room : Room
        The input room for which to find the closest matching room.
    others : list[Room], optional
        A list of other rooms. If not provided, all rooms in the list are considered.

    Returns
    -------
    Room or None
        The room with the minimum distance from the input room. If no matching rooms are found, returns None.

    Find the closest matching room to a given room in a collection.

    x and y coordinates of two nearby rooms) and selects the room with the smallest
    calculated distance.
