    Returns

    ## `connect_rooms` Function

### Return Type
The return value for the `connect_rooms` function is None.

### Description
This function connects two rooms in a grid to create a path between them. It generates random starting points along the paths from both rooms, checks for collisions, and updates the current position accordingly.

### Special Cases

* If `good` is True, the function marks both rooms as connected and adds them to the list of connected rooms.
* The function uses two separate while loops to generate the two path parts: one from the current room to the closest available room, and another from the closest room to the current room. This allows for efficient searching and collision detection.

### Return Value
The `connect_rooms` function does not return any value explicitly; it modifies the objects passed as arguments in its methods (self) instead of returning a new object.
    Examples

    Here are three usage examples for the `connect_rooms` function:

```python
# Basic usage
def connect_rooms(rooms):
    """Connects a specified number of rooms in a network."""
    # Create a graph where each node is a room and the edges represent connections between them
    graph = {}
    for i, room1 in enumerate(rooms):
        if i == 0:
            continue
        graph[room1] = []
        
        for j, room2 in enumerate(rooms[i+1:], start=i+1):
            if j < len(rooms) - 1:
                graph[room1].append(room2)

    # Find the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm
    mst = []
    edges = sorted(graph.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    for edge in edges:
        room1, room2 = edge
        if not any(edge[0] == r1 and edge[1] == r2 for r1, r2 in graph):
            mst.append(edge)
            # Union the two rooms in the minimum spanning tree using union-find data structure
            # For simplicity, we assume a disjoint-set data structure is available
            if room1 != room2:
                parent = find_parent(graph, room1)
                root = find_parent(graph, room2)
                if parent != root:
                    union(graph, parent, root)

    return mst

# Edge case: Input with no rooms
def connect_rooms_no_rooms():
    """Connects 0 rooms."""
    # Simulate an empty graph
    graph = {}
    
    # Return a list of edges representing the "connection"
    return [('1', '2')] + [(i, j) for i in range(3)]

# Edge case: Input with duplicate rooms
def connect_rooms_duplicates():
    """Connects 3 distinct but not identical rooms."""
    # Simulate an empty graph
    graph = {}
    
    # Create a list of edges representing the "connection"
    return [('1', '2'), ('2', '3'), ('1', '3')]
```

```python
# Advanced scenario: Input with negative weights and cycles
def connect_rooms_negative_weights():
    """Connects rooms in a network with negative weight edges."""
    # Simulate an empty graph
    graph = {}
    
    # Create a list of edges representing the "connection"
    return [('1', '2'), ('2', '-3'), ('1', '-4')]
```
