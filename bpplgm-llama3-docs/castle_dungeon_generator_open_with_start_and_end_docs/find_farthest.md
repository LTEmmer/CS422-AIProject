### Parameters

*   `self`: A reference to the instance of the class this function belongs to. Used for method invocation and storing instance-specific data.
*   `rooms`: A list of rooms in the system, where each element is a dictionary containing information about a single room (e.g., 'x', 'y', 'w', 'h').
*   None
    Returns

#### Return Value

- **Type:** `tuple` (returns a pair of rooms)
- **Description:** The pair of rooms that are farthest apart in the list of rooms. If there are multiple rooms with the same maximum distance, both pairs will be returned.
- **Special Cases:**

    - **No rooms found**: In such cases, an empty tuple `[]` is returned.
