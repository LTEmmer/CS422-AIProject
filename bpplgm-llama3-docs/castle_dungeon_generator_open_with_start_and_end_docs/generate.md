# generate

    Purpose

    Here is a description of the purpose of the given Python function in 1-2 sentences:

This function generates a 2D map with rooms, walls, and geometry using a grid-based layout. It constructs the map by dividing it into regions, placing rooms at random locations within those regions, connecting them if they do not collide, and adding walls between adjacent regions.

**Existing functionality:**

* Initializes an empty 2D array to represent the map
* Plots initial room configurations with 't' values indicating whether a room is connected to another or occupied
* Generates rooms at random locations within designated areas of the map
* Connects rooms if they do not collide and adds walls between adjacent regions
* Marks start and end points on the map
* Adds geometry to the map, including farthest room and connected room detection
    Parameters

    ```

    Generates a floorplan by creating rooms and connecting them.

    The algorithm first initializes an empty map with random room sizes and positions.
    It then creates rooms randomly, connects them together if they don't collide,
    shrinks the map down to one room size, builds walls around the connected rooms,
    marks the start and end points of each room, places geometry objects in their respective spaces.
