# cleanup_mesh

    Purpose

    ```python
def cleanup_mesh():
    """
    Cleans up a 3D mesh object by toggling selection, joining its components,
    switching to editing mode, removing overlapping vertices, deselecting everything,
    and exiting editing mode.

    The function selects all objects in the scene, joins them into one single mesh,
    switches to edit mode, removes duplicate vertices, de-selects the selected mesh,
    exits edit mode.
    """
```
    Parameters

    ```python
def cleanup_mesh():
    """
    Cleans up a 3D mesh object by toggling selection, joining its components,
    switching to editing mode, removing overlapping vertices, deselecting everything,
    and exiting editing mode.

    The function selects all objects in the scene, joins them into one single mesh,
    switches to edit mode, removes duplicate vertices, de-selects the selected mesh,
    exits edit mode.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    None
    
    Notes
    -----
    This function does not take any parameters. It operates directly on the entire 3D
    scene without modifying any specific object or attribute.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from mayakit import Mesh
    >>>
    >>> mesh = Mesh()
    >>> # No explicit cleanup needed, as all objects are selected by default
    >>> mesh.cleanup_mesh()
```
    Returns

    ```python
def cleanup_mesh():
    """

    Return type: list

    Description:
