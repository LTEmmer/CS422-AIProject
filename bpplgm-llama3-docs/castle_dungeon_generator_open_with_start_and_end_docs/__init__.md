# __init__

    Purpose

    ## Initialization of Room Information

The given Python function is designed to initialize the initial conditions and state of a room system, including the dimensions, maximum and minimum sizes, number of rooms, map representation, rooms themselves, first and last rooms, end and start points, and light availability.

### Functionality:

* Initializes the `x_size` and `y_size` variables with default values (60 and 40, respectively).
* Defines the range for `min_room_size` and `max_room_size`.
* Creates empty instances of `num_rooms`, `map`, `rooms`, `first_room`, `last_room`, `end`, `start`, and `connected` to store room information.
* Sets default initial values for these variables: `None` indicates that they have not been initialized yet.
    Parameters

    ```python
def __init__(self):
    """
    Initializes the room information system.

    Parameters:
        None

    Functionality:
        Initializes the initial conditions and state of a room system, including dimensions, maximum and minimum sizes,
        number of rooms, map representation, rooms themselves, first and last rooms, end and start points, and light availability.

    Returns

    ### Return Value for `__init__`

**Return Type:** None

**Description:** The function `__init__` initializes and sets up the initial conditions and state of a room system.

**Special Cases:**

* If `x_size` or `y_size` are not provided, they default to 60 and 40, respectively.
* If `num_rooms` is not initialized, it defaults to an empty list.
    Examples

    Here are three examples for `__init__` method:

```python
# Basic usage
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

person1 = Person('John Doe', 30)
print(person1.name)  # John Doe
print(person1.age)   # 30

# Edge case: Initializing with invalid type
class InvalidTypeException(Exception):
    pass

try:
    person2 = Person(123, 'thirty-three')
except InvalidTypeException as e:
    print(e)  # Raises InvalidTypeException

# Advanced scenario: Overriding the __init__ method of a subclass
class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, age, student_id):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.student_id = student_id

student1 = Student('Alex Chen', 25, 'S12345')
print(student1.name)   # Alex Chen
print(student1.age)    # 25
print(student1.student_id)  # S12345

    """```python
class RoomManager:
    """
    A class used to manage rooms in a map.

    The room manager is responsible for maintaining information about 
    rooms on a map, including their size and layout. It also tracks the 
    number and location of each room in the map.

    Attributes:
        x_size (int): The width of the map.
        y_size (int): The height of the map.
        min_room_size (int): The minimum size of a room.
        max_room_size (int): The maximum size of a room.
        num_rooms (int): The total number of rooms in the map, or None if not initialized.
        min_rooms (int): The minimum number of rooms required for the map to be considered connected.
        max_rooms (int): The maximum number of rooms required for the map to be considered connected.
        map (dict): A dictionary representing the map, where each key is a room and its value is another 
            dictionary containing information about that room. The inner dictionary has keys 'x', 'y', 'min_room_size', 
            'max_room_size', and 'num_rooms'.
        rooms (list): A list of dictionaries representing all the rooms in the map.
        first_room (dict): The first room on the map, or None if not initialized.
        last_room (dict): The last room on the map, or None if not initialized.
        end (dict): The endpoint of a path from a start to an end room, or None if not initialized.
        start (dict): The starting room for a path, or None if not initialized.
        connected (bool): A boolean indicating whether the map is fully connected, or False otherwise.
        light (int): A variable representing the number of lights in the map.
