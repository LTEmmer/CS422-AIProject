```

**Return type:** `bool` (True or False indicating whether a collision occurred)

**Description:** The function checks for collisions between two rooms based on their positions. It iterates over each room, comparing it to the current room being checked (`room`). If a pair of rooms is found that are not the same, and both have valid boundaries, the function returns True (collision detected). Otherwise, it returns False (no collision).

**Special cases:**

* No collisions occur when two different rooms are compared. In such cases, the loop completes without finding any overlapping rooms.
* When a single room is compared to itself (`room == comparison_room`), no collisions are detected because there's only one room involved in the comparison.
    Examples

    ```python
def does_collide(point1, point2):
    """
    Checks if two points in 2D space collide.

    Args:
        point1 (tuple): The coordinates of the first point.
        point2 (tuple): The coordinates of the second point.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the points collide, False otherwise.

    Example:
    ```python
    # Explanation
    point1 = (1, 2)
    point2 = (3, 4)

    # This example checks for collision between two points.
    print(does_collide(point1, point2))  # Output: True

    # Explanation
    import math

        Args:

            point2 (tuple): The coordinates of the second point.

        Returns:
            bool: True if the points collide, False otherwise.

        Example:
        ```python
