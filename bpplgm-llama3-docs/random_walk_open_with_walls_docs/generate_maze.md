# generate_maze

    Purpose

    ## `generate_maze` Function Description

The `generate_maze` function simulates the generation of a maze by iteratively choosing random directions and placing walls within it, ultimately resulting in a randomly filled mesh.

## Existing Functionality Documentation

### Function Signature
```python
def generate_maze():
```
This defines the `generate_maze` function with no arguments.

### `for i in range(ITERATIONS):` Loop Iteration
```python
for i in range(ITERATIONS):
```
The function iterates over a sequence of integers, likely representing iteration numbers.

### `direction = get_random_direction()`: Random Direction Selection
```python
direction = get_random_direction()
```
This line selects a random direction for the maze generation process. The actual direction selection method is not specified in this code snippet.

### `next_move(direction)`: Choose Next Move Based on Current Direction
```python
next_move(direction)
```
This line calls another function, likely `choose_next_move`, to determine the next move based on the current chosen direction.

### `build_walls()`: Add Walls to the Maze
```python
build_walls()
```
This function is called after determining the next move, adding walls to the maze according to the chosen direction.

### `cleanup_mesh()`: Clean Up After Maze Generation
```python
cleanup_mesh()
```
This line calls another function, likely `clean_up_mesh`, to prepare the mesh for its final use or disposal.

### Function Signature
```python
def generate_maze():
```
This defines the `generate_maze` function with no arguments.

### Return Value Description
The return value is an empty list, [].
    This indicates that there are no output values or results generated by the function.

### Function Signature
```python
def generate_maze():
```
This defines the `generate_maze` function with no arguments.

### `for i in range(ITERATIONS):` Loop Iteration
```python
for i in range(ITERATIONS):
```
The function iterates over a sequence of integers, likely representing iteration numbers.

### `direction = get_random_direction()`: Random Direction Selection
This line selects a random direction for the maze generation process.
    * Description: The actual direction selection method is not specified in this code snippet. It may involve accessing external data structures or using algorithms for selecting directions.
    * Return type: string (or other value)
        - Description: The selected direction as a string, e.g., 'north', 'east', etc.
    - Special cases:
        1. If the generated maze is invalid or unplayable, an error may be raised with details on how to handle this scenario.
        2. In certain environments, the function might encounter exceptions due to external factors like network connections or system crashes.

### `next_move(direction)`: Choose Next Move Based on Current Direction
This line calls another function, likely `choose_next_move`, to determine the next move based on the current chosen direction.
    * Description: The specific implementation of this function is not provided in the given code snippet. It may involve accessing internal data structures or using algorithms for navigation and decision-making.
    - Return type: None (void)
        - Description: No return value, indicating that the function does not produce any output.

### `build_walls()`: Add Walls to the Maze
This function is called after determining the next move, adding walls to the maze according to the chosen direction.
    * Description: The implementation of this function depends on external dependencies like collision detection algorithms and wall drawing libraries. It may also involve updating internal data structures or calling other functions.
    - Return type: None (void)
        - Description: No return value.

### `cleanup_mesh()`: Clean Up After Maze Generation
This line calls another function, likely `clean_up_mesh`, to prepare the mesh for its final use or disposal.
    * Description: The implementation of this function depends on external dependencies like graphics rendering engines and data structures management systems. It may also involve calling other functions or updating internal state.
    - Return type: None (void)
        - Description: No return value.

**Examples**

```python
import random

# Call the generate_maze function with default parameters
maze = generate_maze()

print(maze)  # Output: []

# Try to call generate_maze with invalid direction
try:
    generate_maze(direction='invalid_direction')
except Exception as e:
    print(e)

# Attempt to get the result of a random direction selection
direction = random.choice(['north', 'east', 'south', 'west'])
print(direction)

    Docstring

    """```python
def generate_maze():
    """
    Generates a random maze by iteratively placing walls and cleaning up the mesh.

    The function first selects a random direction at each iteration. In subsequent iterations,
    it moves in that direction, adding walls as necessary to build a connected maze. Finally, it
    cleans up any remaining vertices.

    This process is repeated for a specified number of iterations, resulting in a fully built maze.

    Parameters:
    None

    Returns:
    None
