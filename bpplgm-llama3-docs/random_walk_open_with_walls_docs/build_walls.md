# build_walls

    Purpose

    ```python
def build_walls():
    """
    Builds walls at all positions that have not been visited yet.

    This function iterates over a list of visited positions, checks their neighbors,
    and places walls at those positions if they haven't already.
    """
```

```python
def check_neighbors_and_place_wall(position):
    # Add your implementation here
    pass

visited = []  # List to keep track of visited positions
for position in visited:
    check_neighbors_and_place_wall(position)
```
    Parameters

    ```python
def build_walls():
    """
    Builds walls at all positions that have not been visited yet.

    This function iterates over a list of visited positions, checks their neighbors,
    and places walls at those positions if they haven't already.
    """
```

### Parameters:

* `visited`: List to keep track of positions that have been visited. 
    Type: List
    Description: The list is used to prevent infinite loops when revisiting the same position multiple times.
    Usage constraints: This parameter is not used in this function, it was a leftover from a previous version.

### Function call:

```python
def check_neighbors_and_place_wall(position):
    """
    Adds neighbors and places walls at them if necessary.

    This function takes a single position as input, calculates its neighboring positions,
    and applies the wall placement rules to those positions.
    
    Args:
        position: The current position for which to calculate neighbors and place walls.

    Returns:
        None
    """

    # Add your implementation here
    pass

visited = []  # List to keep track of visited positions
for position in visited:
    check_neighbors_and_place_wall(position)
```

### Parameters:

* `position`: The current position for which to calculate neighbors and place walls. 
    Type: Position or integer (if using coordinates as input)
    Description: This parameter is not used in this function, it was a leftover from a previous version.
    Usage constraints: This parameter should be the absolute position where walls are being checked and placed. It can also be an integer coordinate if provided.

### Function call:

```python
def build_walls():
    """
    Builds walls at all positions that have not been visited yet.

    This function iterates over a list of visited positions, checks their neighbors,
    and places walls at those positions if they haven't already.
    """
```
    Returns

    ```python
def build_walls() -> list:
    """
    Builds walls at all positions that have not been visited yet.

    Returns:
        list: A list of wall positions where walls were built.

    Description:
        This function iterates over a list of visited positions, checks their neighbors,
        and places walls at those positions if they haven't already. The function
        returns the positions where walls were built.

    Special cases:
        None: If the input position is not provided or has no unvisited neighbors.
