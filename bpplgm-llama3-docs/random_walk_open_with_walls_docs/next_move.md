# next_move

    Purpose

    The purpose of this function is to determine the next position to move from a given direction and update the game state accordingly, by updating the positions of tiles on the board. 

```python
def next_move(direction):
    global y_pos
    global x_pos

    if direction == 'up':
        y_pos += Y_MOVE_DISTANCE

    if direction == 'right':
        x_pos += X_MOVE_DISTANCE

    if direction == 'down':
        y_pos -= Y_MOVE_DISTANCE

    if direction == 'left':
        x_pos -= X_MOVE_DISTANCE
place_tile(x_pos, y_pos)
visited.append((x_pos, y_pos))
```
    Parameters
