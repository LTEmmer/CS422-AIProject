# cleanup_mesh

    Purpose

    ```python
def cleanup_mesh():
    """
    Joins and merges multiple selected cube objects, then transitions to edit mode.

    This function selects all cube objects, joins them into a single object,
    toggles the edit mode, selects all vertices, removes overlapping ones,
    and returns out of edit mode.
    """
```
    Parameters

    ```python
def cleanup_mesh():
    """
    Joins and merges multiple selected cube objects, then transitions to edit mode.

    This function selects all cube objects, joins them into a single object,
    toggles the edit mode, selects all vertices, removes overlapping ones,
    and returns out of edit mode.

    Parameters
    ----------
    None

    Returns
    -------
    None

    Returns

    ```python
def cleanup_mesh():
    """
    Returns a list containing 0 if no mesh was found to be cleaned.

    Return type: list
    Description: An empty list [] is returned when no cube objects are selected or merged.
    Special cases:
        - If the input function does not select any cube objects, an empty list [] is returned.
    """
    return []
```
    Examples

    ```python
def cleanup_mesh(mesh):
    """
    Cleans up a mesh by removing unnecessary data.

    Args:
        mesh (list of lists): The input mesh data.

    Returns:
        list of lists: The cleaned-up mesh data.
    """

    # Example 1: Basic usage
    # Create an example mesh with some initial values
    mesh = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

    # Clean up the mesh by removing empty cells
    cleaned_mesh = []
    for row in mesh:
        new_row = [cell for cell in row if cell != 0]
        cleaned_mesh.append(new_row)

    return cleaned_mesh

# Example 2: Edge case - Mesh with only one element
# Create an example mesh that is essentially a single point
mesh = [[1]]

# Clean up the mesh by removing empty cells (not applicable)
# cleaned_mesh = []
# print(cleanup_mesh(mesh))  # Output: []

# Example 3: Advanced scenario - Mesh with complex connectivity
# Create an example mesh representing a network of edges and nodes
mesh = [[[0, 0], [1, 1]], [[2, 2], [3, 3]], [[4, 4], [5, 5]]]

# Clean up the mesh by removing redundant edges (not applicable)
# cleaned_mesh = []
# print(cleanup_mesh(mesh))  # Output: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
```

Please note that there is no edge case or advanced scenario example provided as per the guidelines. The examples are based on the existing function `cleanup_mesh` and demonstrate its usage in different scenarios.

    """```python
def cleanup_mesh():
    """
    Cleans up a 3D mesh by selecting all vertices, removing duplicates,
    and switching back to edit mode.

    A one-line description:

        Removes overlapping vertices from a mesh and returns it in an editable state.
