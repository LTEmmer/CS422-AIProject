# cleanup_mesh

    Purpose

    ```
def cleanup_mesh():
    """
    Selects and merges multiple 3D objects into one, then deletes face selection.
    
    This function optimizes the mesh of three separate objects by removing 
    overlapping faces (usually floor/ceiling and wall intersections) to create 
    a hollow or empty shape. It sets the object's editing mode and removes face 
    selection to simplify the resulting mesh.

    Returns:
        None

```

```python
# Explanation:
# The 'cleanup_mesh' function removes unused vertices and edges from a given mesh.
# It checks for unused vertices by verifying that each vertex has at least three indices.
# Then it checks if the vertex is connected to another (i.e., not isolated) and removes them if necessary.
# Note: This implementation assumes that all input data is valid.
```

```python
# Explanation:
# A 'cleanup_mesh_edge_case' function specifically cleans up a mesh with only two vertices or no edges.
# It prints a warning message when there are multiple vertices or no edges, suggesting manual cleanup for such cases.
