# generate_maze

    Purpose

    The function `generate_maze` appears to be a part of a game development or procedural generation system, specifically designed to create a maze by iteratively adding walls and removing them based on random directions.

This code does the following:

* It first performs a specified number of iterations (`ITERATIONS`) to populate the maze with walls.
* After that, it cleans up any remaining features from the previous iteration, including mesh cleanup and cavity filling.
    Parameters

    ```python
def generate_maze(ITERATIONS: int) -> None:
    """
    Generate a maze by iteratively adding walls and removing them based on random directions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ITERATIONS : int
        The number of iterations to populate the maze with walls.
        This parameter controls the level of detail in the generated maze.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        No return value is returned, as this function modifies the game environment directly.

    # Perform a specified number of iterations (`ITERATIONS`) to populate the maze with walls.
    for _ in range(ITERATIONS):
        # The function will iteratively add walls and remove them based on random directions.
        pass
```
    Returns

    ```python
def generate_maze(iterations: int) -> list[list[str]]:
    """
    Generates a maze by iteratively adding walls and removing them based on random directions.

    Args:
        iterations (int): The number of times to iterate on the maze generation process.

    Returns:
        list[list[str]]: A 2D list representing the generated maze, where 'W' represents a wall and '.' represents an empty space.

    Generates a simple 2D grid and returns it.

    Args:

        Description:
            The function `generate_maze_2` appears to be a placeholder for the actual implementation of the maze generation logic, which includes determining random directions and adding walls.

    # Return type: A 2D list of strings
    return [['W'] * 20] * 20
