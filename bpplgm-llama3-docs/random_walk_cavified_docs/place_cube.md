# place_cube

    Purpose

    The function `place_cube()` creates a new cube object in Blender's 3D modeling software using the Mesh Primitive Adder tool. 

```python
def place_cube():
    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=2, enter_editmode=False, location=(x_pos, y_pos, 0))
```
This function generates a cube with a size of 2 units and is positioned in the first octant (i.e., not centered) at specified coordinates (x_pos, y_pos, z=0).
    Parameters

    ```python
def place_cube():
    """
    Creates a new cube object in Blender's 3D modeling software using the Mesh Primitive Adder tool.

    Parameters:
    None

    Function purpose: The function `place_cube()` generates a cube with a size of 2 units and is positioned 
                      in the first octant (i.e., not centered) at specified coordinates (x_pos, y_pos, z=0).
    """
```

This function generates a cube with a size of 2 units and is positioned in the first octant (i.e., not centered) at specified coordinates (x_pos, y_pos, z=0).
    Returns

    ```python
def place_cube():
    """
    Creates a new cube object in Blender's 3D modeling software using the Mesh Primitive Adder tool.

    Returns:
        A string representing the path to the newly created cube object in Blender.
    """
    # Return type: str
    # Description: The function returns a string that represents the absolute path of the newly created cube object in Blender.
    # Special cases:
    # - If an error occurs during the execution, it is not returned; instead, an error message will be raised.
```
    Examples

    ```python
def place_cube(size):
    """
    Place a cube on a 3D space.

    Args:
        size (int): The size of each side of the cube in inches.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the coordinates and shapes of all cubes.
