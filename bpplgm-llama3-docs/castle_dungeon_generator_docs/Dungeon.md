# Dungeon

    Purpose

    **Dungeon Class Overview**

The `Dungeon` class represents a 2D grid-based dungeon generation system. It initializes a dungeon with an arbitrary size (x_size and y_size), sets the number of rooms to be generated within that space (min_rooms and max_rooms). The room sizes are constrained between min_room_size and max_room_size, where each room has a minimum width and height.

**Initialization**

The `__init__` method initializes several instance variables:

- `x_size`: The horizontal size of the dungeon grid.
- `y_size`: The vertical size of the dungeon grid.
- `min_rooms`, `max_rooms`: The range of possible room sizes (10 to 15).
- `num_rooms`: The total number of rooms generated in the dungeon. This is set by calling `get_random_int(min_rooms, max_rooms)`.
- `map`: A 2D list representing the dungeon grid.
- `rooms`: A list of all generated rooms.
- `connected`: A list to store connected rooms between each pair of rooms.

**Room Generation**

The `generate` method populates the dungeon map and sets up initial room connections. It does the following:

- Initializes an empty 2D list for each row in the dungeon grid (self.map) with dimensions x_size by y_size.
- Iterates over each possible room position, generating a new random room size between min_room_size and max_room_size if necessary.
- For each generated room:
  - Checks if the room overlaps with any existing rooms using `does_collide`.
  - If there is overlap or no overlap, generates a new room with its own unique dimensions (x, y).
  - Connects the newly generated room to one of the existing connected rooms by finding the closest matching room.
- Marks each empty space in the dungeon grid as occupied (`t` value set to 1) and adds it to the `map`.
- Resets the room occupancy status for any rooms that have been connected.

**Collision Checking**

The `does_collide` method checks whether two rooms overlap. It iterates through all possible positions of each room, comparing their x and y coordinates with those of another room's position within its bounds.

**Closest Room Finding**

The `find_closest` method finds the closest matching room for a given room. If an option is provided (other rooms), it iterates over them to find the one that best matches the target room's position. It then returns this closest matching room.

**Connection Generation**

The `connect_rooms` method connects two connected rooms by creating path segments between their positions on the dungeon grid. These paths are used to mark occupied space in the dungeon map as connected (i.e., a single cube is placed at each end of a segment).

**Cube Placement**

The `place_cubes` method places cubes along the dungeon grid's edges, using primitive cubes from Blender's mesh module. This creates the illusion of a filled-in 2D grid.

Note that this code snippet appears to be part of a larger project with additional functionality and dependencies (e.g., Blender for rendering).
