# place_cubes

    Purpose

    This function is designed to iterate over a grid of coordinates (x, y) in the `map` data structure and add cube primitives to each cell that has not been explicitly blocked ('t' value equals 2). 

The cubes are then placed within edit mode at their current location. The 'enter_editmode=False' argument prevents the user from editing the cube, while 'location=(xx, yy, 0)' specifies its initial position in three-dimensional space.
    Parameters

    ```python
def place_cubes(self, map_data: dict, **kwargs) -> None:
    """
    This function is designed to iterate over a grid of coordinates (x, y) in the `map` data structure and add cube primitives 
    to each cell that has not been explicitly blocked ('t' value equals 2).

    Parameters:
    map_data (dict): A dictionary representing the grid of coordinates. It should have 'x', 'y', and 'grid_size' keys.
    **kwargs: Keyword arguments with any additional parameters. Currently, only 'enter_editmode=False' is supported.

    Returns:
    None

    Usage Constraints:
    - The 'map_data' parameter must be a dictionary representing a grid of coordinates.
    - The 'enter_editmode=False' argument prevents the user from editing the cube in edit mode.
    - The `location` keyword argument specifies the initial position of the cube in three-dimensional space.

    Example Usage:
    >>> map_data = {'x': 0, 'y': 0, 'grid_size': (10, 10)}
    >>> place_cubes(map_data)
    >>> # ... additional code ...

In this code:

*   The function `place_cubes` takes a dictionary representing the map data as input.
*   It iterates over each cell in the grid using the `zip` function to pair coordinates with each other.
*   For each unblocked cell, it adds a cube at its initial position (0) by setting all values except 't' to 2.
*   The updated coordinates are returned as a list of tuples.
    Examples

    ```python
def place_cubes(num_cubes, side_length):
    """
    Placing cubes on a grid.

    Args:
        num_cubes (int): The number of cubes to place.
        side_length (float): The length of each cube's edge.

    Returns:
        list: A 2D list representing the placed cubes.
    """
    # Explanation
    # This function takes in the number of cubes and the side length of a single cube,
    # then generates a 2D grid with the specified number of rows and columns,
    # placing each cube at the intersection of two adjacent cells.

    code = [
        [""] * (side_length + 1)
        for _ in range(num_cubes + 1)
    ]

    # Explanation
    # The outer list comprehension iterates over each row in the grid, creating a new row with zeros.
    # Then, the inner list comprehension iterates over each column, placing a cube at the intersection of two adjacent cells.

    return code

# Basic usage
print(place_cubes(3, 5))

# Edge case: No cubes are placed
print(place_cubes(0, 5))

# Advanced scenario: Place cubes on a grid with alternating colors
print("\nPlace cubes on a grid with alternating colors:")
for row in place_cubes(10, 2):
    print(" ".join(row))

    Docstring

    """```python
def place_cubes(self):
    """
    Generates a list of primitive cube objects to be placed on the map.

    This function iterates over each cell in the map, and if a cell is not occupied or occupied by a non-object object,
    it creates a new cube primitive using Blender's add primitive operation. The resulting cubes are placed at coordinates
    that increment the x-axis by 2 units for each row, starting from the top-left corner of the map.

    Args:
        self: An instance of the Map class

    Returns:
        A list of primitive cube objects, or None if the map is empty

    Examples:
        >>> map = MyMap()
        >>> cubes = map.place_cubes()
        >>> print(cubes)
