# clear_scene

    Purpose

    The given function, `clear_scene`, appears to be a part of the Blender Python API and is intended to clear or reset the currently active object's scene by resetting its mode to 'OBJECT', selecting all objects, deleting them, and setting their selection to global. 

```python
def clear_scene():
    """
    Resets the active object's scene to 'OBJECT' mode, selects all objects,
    deletes them, and sets their selection to global.

    This function is typically used after a scene has been modified or changed.
    It provides an efficient way to reset the scene to its default state.
    """

    # Check if there is currently an active object
    if bpy.context.active_object:
        # If not, try to switch back to 'OBJECT' mode
        if bpy.context.active_object.mode != 'OBJECT':
            bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')
        
        # Select all objects in the scene
        bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')
        
        # Delete all objects in the scene (except for global selection)
        bpy.ops.object.delete(use_global=False)
```
    Parameters

    Here is the documented code:

```python

    Parameters
    ----------
    None

    Returns
    -------
    None

    Examples
    --------
    To clear the current scene, simply call `clear_scene()` without any arguments:
    >>> from bpy import applog
    ... applog.clear()
    Clearing Blender console log...

    Description:
        The given function, `clear_scene`, appears to be a part of the Blender Python API
        and is intended to clear or reset the currently active object's scene by resetting its mode to 'OBJECT',
        selecting all objects, deleting them, and setting their selection to global.

    Special cases:
        - If there is already an active object in the scene (bpy.context.active_object), this function will attempt
          to switch back to 'OBJECT' mode if it has changed. It then selects all objects using `bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')`,
          deletes them using `bpy.ops.object.delete(use_global=False)`, and sets their selection to global.
