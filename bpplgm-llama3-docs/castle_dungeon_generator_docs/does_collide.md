# does_collide

    Purpose

    ```
def does_collide(self, room):
    """
    Checks if a given room collides with any other rooms in the list.

    A room is considered to collide with another room if it overlaps both horizontally and vertically
    with that room. The overlapping regions are defined by the sum of the widths and heights of both rooms.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the given room collides with any other room, False otherwise.

```
    Parameters

    ```python
def does_collide(self, room):
    """
    Checks if a given room collides with any other rooms in the list.

    A room is considered to collide with another room if it overlaps both horizontally and vertically
    with that room. The overlapping regions are defined by the sum of the widths and heights of both rooms.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    self : Room
        The current room being checked for collision.
    room : Room
        The room to check for collision against other rooms.

    Returns
    -------
    bool: True if the given room collides with any other room, False otherwise.

    Usage Constraints
    --------------
    None. This function assumes that both parameters are valid instances of the `Room` class.

    Examples

    ```python
def does_collide(point1, point2):
    """
    Checks if two points are colliding.

    Args:

    Returns:

    """
    # Explanation
    # This function checks if two given points are on the same line by calculating their slopes
    # If the product of their slopes is equal to -1, then they are colliding

    x1, y1 = point1  # Unpack the coordinates of point1
    x2, y2 = point2  # Unpack the coordinates of point2

    # Calculate the slope of the line connecting point1 and point2
    m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

    # Check if a third colliding point would create an isosceles triangle
    return abs(m - (x1 + y1) / 4.0) < 0.001

# Example usage:
point_a = (10, 5)
point_b = (15, 8)
print(does_collide(point_a, point_b))  # Expected output: True

point_c = (20, 12)

    Checks if two rooms in a list collide.

    A collision is determined by checking if both rooms overlap with each other
