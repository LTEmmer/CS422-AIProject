    Returns

    **return value for 'generate'**

*   The return value is a list of rooms (`self.rooms`) that have been connected and placed into the grid map.

**Documentation of the existing functionality**

The `generate` method builds an initial 2D grid array with empty rooms, checks for overlap, shrinks the room size by one unit until no more overlaps can be found, adds rooms to the list if they do not collide, connects rooms that do not collide, marks connected rooms as occupied, and places them into the grid map.

**Examples**

*   `generate()` is called when an instance of the class needs to generate a new set of rooms for placement in the grid map.
*   The generated rooms are stored in the `self.rooms` list.
*   After generating all rooms, their neighbors are connected if necessary, and marked as occupied.
*   The connected rooms are then placed into the grid map by calling the `place_cubes()` method.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage
def generate():
    """Generate a list of numbers."""
    return [i for i in range(1, 11)]

# Edge case
def generate_with_empty_list():
    """Generate an empty list when requested."""
    return []

# Advanced scenario (if applicable)
def generate_with_large_number():
    """Generate a large number of random integers within a specified range."""
    import random
    return [random.randint(-1000000, 1000000) for _ in range(100000)]
```

```python
# Explanation
numbers = generate()
print(numbers)

empty_list = generate_with_empty_list()
print(empty_list)
```

```python
# Explanation
large_numbers = generate_with_large_number()

A one-line description of what the code currently does:

 Generates a set of rooms with random placements within an initial grid, ensuring no overlapping rooms and connecting them to form a cohesive structure.

Documentation of the existing functionality:

*   The `generate` method initializes an empty map, list of rooms, and connected rooms.
*   It calculates the total number of rooms to be generated between specified minimum and maximum values.
*   For each room generation iteration:
    *   Generates random coordinates for the room's x and y positions within a predefined size range.
    *   Sets the room's width and height to randomly selected values, ensuring they fit within the grid boundaries.
    *   Checks if the room overlaps with any existing rooms; if so, it skips this generation step.
    *   Connects non-overlapping rooms in each iteration.
*   After all rooms are generated, the map is marked as occupied (set to 1) for marked positions.

Examples of usage:

```python
# Create a RoomGenerator instance
room_generator = RoomGenerator()

# Generate and print rooms
rooms = room_generator.generate()
print(rooms)
```

The provided code will output an array of rooms generated within the initial grid, which can be used as input for further processing or visualization."""
