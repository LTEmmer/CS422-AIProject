# find_closest

    Purpose

    ```python
def find_closest(self, room, others=None):
    """
    Find the closest room to a given room in a collection of rooms.

    If multiple rooms are considered equal (i.e., have the same 'x' and 'y' coordinates),
    this function returns the first one encountered.

    Parameters:
    self (Room): The list of rooms containing the target room.
    others (list, optional): A list of other rooms to consider for closeness. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
    Room: The closest room to the given room in the collection.

    # Description: The target room for which this function finds the closest match in the collection.

    # Usage constraints: This parameter can only accept a valid Room object (i.e., an instance of Room).
