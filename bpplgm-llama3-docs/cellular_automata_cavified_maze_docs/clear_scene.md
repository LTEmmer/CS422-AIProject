```python
def clear_scene():
    """
    Clears and deletes the current selected object in Blender's Object Mode.
    
    The function first polls for the current mode, switches to Object Mode if necessary,
    then selects all objects in Object Mode with the 'SELECT' action, and finally deletes
    them using Blender's delete command.

    Parameters:
    None

    Returns:
    None
    """
    if bpy.ops.object.mode_set.poll():
        bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')
        bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')
        bpy.ops.object.delete(use_global=False)
```
    Parameters

    Here is the documented code:

    Parameters:
    None

    Returns:
        None: The function does not return any value.

    Description:
        This function clears and deletes an object in Blender's Object Mode by polling for mode,
        switching to Object Mode if necessary, selecting all objects with the 'SELECT' action,
        and deleting them using Blender's delete command. The selected object is then removed
        from the active selection list.

    Special cases:

        - If Blender is already in Object Mode, this function does not attempt to switch back.
