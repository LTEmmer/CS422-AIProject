# initialize_map

    Purpose

    This function initializes a 2D array (map) with a specified width and height, initialized with empty cells that are assumed to be "alive" based on the calculation provided by `alive_calc`. 

```
def initialize_map():
    """
    Initializes a 2D array (map) with a specified width and height, 
    where each cell is either alive or dead based on the result of 'alive_calc'.

    Returns:
        initial_map: A 2D list representing the map.
    """
initial_map = [[alive_calc() for i in range(WIDTH)] for j in range(HEIGHT)]
return initial_map

    Parameters

    ```python

        initial_map: A 2D list representing the map.

    Examples:
        >>> initialize_map()

    Returns:
        initial_map: A 2D list representing the map.

    Description:
        This function initializes a 2D array (map) with a specified width and height,
        using an algorithm to determine whether each cell should be "alive" or "dead".
        The decision is based on the result of 'alive_calc', which calculates the status
        of each cell in the map.

    Special cases:
        If the input 'WIDTH' and 'HEIGHT' are not positive integers, 
        the function will raise a ValueError.
