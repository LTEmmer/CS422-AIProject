# perform_game_of_life_iteration

    Purpose

    This Python function, named `perform_game_of_life_iteration`, performs an individual iteration of the Game of Life algorithm on a given level map. It updates the game state to reflect the next generation of cell values based on their current and surrounding neighbor counts.

In 1-2 sentences:

The purpose of this code is to iterate through each cell in a level map, applying the rules of the Game of Life (a cellular automaton) to determine the fate of its neighboring cells.

```python
def perform_game_of_life_iteration(old_map):
    new_map = [[False for i in range(WIDTH)] for j in range(HEIGHT)]
    # Loop over each row and column of the level_map
    for x in range(len(old_map)):
        for y in range(len(old_map[0])):
            live_neighbor_count = count_alive_neighbors(old_map, x, y)

            if old_map[x][y] is True:
                # See if it should die and become open
                if live_neighbor_count < DEATH_LIMIT:
                    new_map[x][y] = False
                # Otherwise keep it as a wall
                else:
                    new_map[x][y] = True
            # If the tile is currently empty
            else:
                # See if it should become a wall
                if live_neighbor_count > BIRTH_LIMIT:
                    new_map[x][y] = True
                else:
                    new_map[x][y] = False
    return new_map
```

```python
old_map  = [[False for _ in range(HEIGHT)] for _ in range(WIDTH)] # Replace WIDTH and HEIGHT with actual values if needed
# Call the function to perform game of life iteration on level map
new_map = perform_game_of_life_iteration(old_map)
print(new_map)
```

Description:
This Python code performs an individual iteration of the Game of Life algorithm on a given level map. It creates a new map and updates its values based on the rules of the Game of Life, simulating the next generation of cell values.

Special cases:

* If a live neighbor count is less than DEATH_LIMIT, it should die and become open.
* Otherwise, it keeps the cell as a wall if there are more or equal BIRTH_LIMIT alive neighbors.
* A tile becomes a wall if it's currently empty and has fewer than DEATH_LIMIT alive neighbors.

A. **One-line description**

The current Game of Life simulation is performed using the following rules:

* If a cell is alive and has less than Death Limit neighboring live cells, it dies and becomes an open space.
* Otherwise, if a cell is dead or has more than Birth Limit surrounding live cells, it becomes a wall.

B. **Args section**

    * `old_map`: A dictionary representing the current state of the level map.
        Each key is a coordinate pair (x, y) indicating a cell in the grid,
        and each value is a boolean indicating whether that cell should be alive or dead.

C. **Returns section**

    * The new level map after one iteration of the Game of Life, with the same coordinates used to determine their new state.
