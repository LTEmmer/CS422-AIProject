# cleanup_mesh

    Purpose

    ```
### Purpose:

The `cleanup_mesh` function appears to be designed to clean up a 3D mesh object by removing overlapping vertices and joining the separate objects into one.

### Functionality Documentation:

1. Selects all meshes in the active scene using `bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')`.
2. Joins the selected meshes together using `bpy.ops.object.join()`, effectively merging them into a single mesh object.
3. Enters edit mode for the resulting mesh using `bpy.ops.object.editmode_toggle()`.
4. Selects all vertices in the merged mesh using `bpy.ops.mesh.select_all(action='SELECT')`.
5. Removes overlapping vertices by deleting doubles using `bpy.ops.mesh.remove_doubles()`.
6. Exits edit mode again using `bpy.ops.object.editmode_toggle()`.

### Notes:

This function seems to be part of a larger automation process, possibly for editing or processing 3D models.
    Parameters

    ```python
def cleanup_mesh():
    """
    Clean up a 3D mesh object by removing overlapping vertices and joining the separate objects into one.

    This function is designed to automate the process of merging multiple meshes in an active scene,
    resulting in a single, unified mesh object. The selected vertices are then removed using the
    `mesh.remove_doubles()` operation, effectively eliminating any duplicate or redundant information.
