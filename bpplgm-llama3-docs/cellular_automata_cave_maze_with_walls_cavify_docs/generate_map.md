# generate_map

    Purpose

    ```python
def generate_map():
    """
    Generates a new level map by initializing it with random values and performing the Game of Life simulation for a set number of steps.

    The function creates a new level map, sets up the initial state, runs the simulation for a specified number of iterations, 
    and then returns the resulting cell map.
    """
```

```python
def initialize_map():
    """
    Initializes a 2D grid with all cells set to 0 (representing empty space).

    The function creates an empty 2D grid filled with zeros, which will be used as the initial state of the level map.
    """

    return [[0 for _ in range(50)] for _ in range(50)]

def perform_game_of_life_iteration(cellmap):
    """
    Performs one iteration of the Game of Life simulation on the given cell map.

    The function takes a 2D grid as input, applies the rules of the Game of Life (birth, death, and movement), 
    and returns the resulting state of the cell map after one step.
    """
```

```python

**Special cases:**

- The `initialize_map` function creates a new 2D grid with all cells set to 0, representing empty space.
- The `perform_game_of_life_iteration` function takes the current cell map and applies the Game of Life rules for one step.
