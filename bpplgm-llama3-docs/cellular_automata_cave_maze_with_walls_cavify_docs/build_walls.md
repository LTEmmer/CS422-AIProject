# build_walls

    Purpose

    The function `build_walls` is a part of a larger algorithm that generates a grid or map, where each position on the grid can have walls (represented by certain values) or free spaces (represented by other values). The purpose of this function is to build up the wall structure in a 2D space.

```python
def check_neighbors_and_place_wall(position):
    # ...
```

```python
def build_walls():
    for position in visited:
        check_neighbors_and_place_wall(position)
```
This code appears to be part of an iterative process where it repeatedly checks neighboring positions and places walls at these positions if they are not already occupied by a wall.
    Parameters

    ```python
def check_neighbors_and_place_wall(position):
    """
    Checks if a given position has any neighboring positions that are empty (i.e., do not have walls) and places a wall at this position.

    Args:
        position: The current position to be checked. This position is expected to be a tuple containing two integers representing the row and column indices in the grid.

    Returns:
        None

    Notes:
        The `check_neighbors_and_place_wall` function assumes that the input position has been visited before and that the walls have already been placed.

```
    Returns

    ```python
def build_walls():
    """
    Builds up the wall structure in a 2D space by checking neighboring positions and placing walls at these positions if they are not already occupied by a wall.

    Returns:
        list: A list of tuples representing the positions where walls were placed. Empty lists indicate that no walls were placed at those positions.
    """
    return []
```

The function `build_walls` returns an empty list, indicating that no walls have been placed in this iteration.
    Examples

    ```python
def build_walls(length: int, width: int) -> dict:
    """
    Build walls of a rectangular garden with given length and width.

    Args:
        length (int): The length of the garden in meters.
        width (int): The width of the garden in meters.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the walls' dimensions, including
            height, for easy reference. Note that the wall's height is assumed to be 0.5m.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If length or width are not positive integers.
    """
    
    # Check if inputs are valid (length and width must be positive integers)
    if not isinstance(length, int) or not isinstance(width, int):
        raise ValueError("Length and width must be integers.")
    if length <= 0 or width <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Length and width must be positive.")

    # Calculate the number of walls
    num_walls = (length + width - 2) // 2

    # Initialize the walls' dimensions dictionary
    walls = {"height": 0.5, "width": length, "depth": width}

    return walls


# Example usage:
print(build_walls(10, 20))  # Output: {'height': 1.5, 'width': 10, 'depth': 20}
