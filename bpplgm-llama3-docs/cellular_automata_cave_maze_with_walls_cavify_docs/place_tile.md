# place_tile

    Purpose

    `The `place_tile` function creates a new plane in Blender's 3D rendering environment with the specified position and size.`

```python
def place_tile(x, y):
    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_plane_add(size=2, enter_editmode=False, location=(x, y, -1))
```

This function prompts the user to input two parameters `x` and `y`, which represent the coordinates of where the new plane should be placed in 3D space. The function then uses Blender's built-in API to create a new plane with a size of 2 units and enters edit mode, allowing it to be customized before being used as part of a larger scene or object.
    Parameters

    ```
def place_tile(x: int, y: int) -> None:
    """
    Creates a new plane in Blender's 3D rendering environment with the specified position and size.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : int
        The x-coordinate (in the world space) of where the new plane should be placed.
    y : int
        The y-coordinate (in the world space) of where the new plane should be placed.

    Usage Constraints
    ---------------
    - The coordinates 'x' and 'y' are non-negative integers.
    - The size of the new plane is a positive integer, with 2 being the default value.

    Returns
    -------
    None

```
    Returns

    ```python
def place_tile(x: int, y: int) -> bpy.types.Plane:
    """
    The `place_tile` function creates a new plane in Blender's 3D rendering environment 
    with the specified position and size.

    Args:
        x (int): The x-coordinate of where the new plane should be placed.
        y (int): The y-coordinate of where the new plane should be placed.

    Returns:
        bpy.types.Plane: A newly created plane in Blender's 3D rendering environment.
    """
    
    # Return a list containing an empty object, as per the return statement
    return []
```

This function prompts the user to input two parameters `x` and `y`, which represent the coordinates of where the new plane should be placed in 3D space. The function then uses Blender's built-in API to create a new plane with a size of 2 units and enters edit mode, allowing it to be customized before being used as part of a larger scene or object.

**Special cases:**

* The `enter_editmode=False` argument indicates that the user will not enter editing mode.
* The `location=(x, y, -1)` argument sets the coordinates of the plane's location in 3D space to `(x, y, -1)`, where `-1` represents negative z-axis direction.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage
def place_tile(image_path):
    """
    Place a tile in a world map at a specified position.

    Args:
        image_path (str): Path to the image file containing the tile data.

    Returns:
        str: The path to the new world map.

    """```python
def place_tile(x: float, y: float) -> None:

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : float

        The y-coordinate where the plane will be created.
