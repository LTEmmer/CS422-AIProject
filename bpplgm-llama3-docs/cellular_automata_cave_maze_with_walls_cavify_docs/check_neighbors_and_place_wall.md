    Returns:
        None

    Usage Constraints:
        - This function assumes that 'place_cube()' is defined elsewhere and called by this function.
        - It also assumes that 'walls' and 'visited' are lists or other data structures defined elsewhere.

    Notes:
        - The offset map used to determine neighboring positions is defined as a 2x4 matrix for the given offset values.
        - This approach allows for efficient exploration of neighboring positions, especially when placing cubes at positions far from each other.

    Args:
        pos (tuple): The position of the cube in 2D space.

    Returns:
        list: A list of tuples representing the visited neighbors that were not walls.

    Description:
    This function attempts to place a cube at the specified position by checking if there are any
    unvisited edges and adding them to the wall list, unless they already exist. It does this by
    iterating over an offset map (a 2D array of tuples representing neighboring positions) that is
    used to determine which points are considered neighbors.

    Special cases:
    None.
