# cavify

    Purpose

    **Purpose:**
This Python function, named `cavify`, appears to be a procedural modeling and rendering script designed for use in Blender, specifically targeting 3D printing simulations and visualizations.

 
*   It sets up the Blender interface by retrieving its window object and screen.
*   It selects specific areas of the screen (2D views) where the model will be created.
*   It creates a new mesh with a loop cut object modifier for creating cavities or holes in the shape of the objects to be printed.
    Parameters

    ```python
def cavify(
    # Function parameters (none)
):
    """
    Sets up the Blender interface by retrieving its window object and screen,
    selects specific areas of the screen for model creation, creates a new mesh with
    a loop cut object modifier for creating cavities or holes in the shape of objects to be printed.

    Args:
        None

    Returns:
        None

    Raises:
        Exception: If there is an error retrieving the window object or screen.

    Docstring

    """```python
def cavify():
    """
    A function to caveify 3D objects in Blender using the SubSurface and Displace modifiers.

    This script performs several tasks:
    - Finds the active window, screen area, and region of a 3D object.
    - Sets the mesh to edit mode.
    - Loops through each face of the object's mesh and cuts away vertices on adjacent faces if necessary (Subsurface modifier).
    - Flips normals on selected objects in the scene.
    - Adds Subdivision and Displace modifiers to surface areas.
    - Creates displacement textures for surface and subsurface areas, applies noise effects, and sets texture properties.

    Returns:
        None
