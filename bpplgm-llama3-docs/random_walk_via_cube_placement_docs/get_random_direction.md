# get_random_direction

    Purpose

    ```python
def get_random_direction():
    """
    Returns a randomly selected direction (up, right, down, left) from the predefined dictionary.

    The function first defines a dictionary that maps numbers to specific directions.
    Then, it generates a random number between 0 and 3 using the randint function.
    Finally, it uses this random number as an index into the dictionary to select a direction.
    """
```
    Parameters

    ```python
def get_random_direction():
    """
    Returns a randomly selected direction (up, right, down, left) from the predefined dictionary.

    The function first defines a dictionary that maps numbers to specific directions.
    Then, it generates a random number between 0 and 3 using the randint function.
    Finally, it uses this random number as an index into the dictionary to select a direction.

    Parameters:
    None

    Usage Constraints:
    - This function does not accept any arguments.
    - It returns a value of type str (direction), which is one of 'up', 'right', 'down', or 'left'.

    Returns

    Returns:
        str: A randomly selected direction (up, right, down, left)

    Description:
        This function randomly selects a direction from up, right, down, or left based on predefined mappings.

    Special cases:
        - If the generated random number is 0, returns 'down'
        - If the generated random number is 1, returns 'right'
        - If the generated random number is 2, returns 'up'
        - If the generated random number is 3, returns 'left'
