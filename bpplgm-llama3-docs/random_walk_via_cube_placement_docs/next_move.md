# next_move

    Purpose

    ```
The purpose of this function is to determine the next move based on the given direction and update the game state accordingly.

```
    Parameters

    ## next_move Function

### Parameters

*   `direction`: string (enum: ["NORTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST"])
    The direction in which to move. Possible values are all four cardinal directions.

### Purpose
The purpose of this function is to determine the next move based on the given direction and update the game state accordingly.
    Returns
