# cleanup_mesh

    Purpose

    ```python
def cleanup_mesh():
    """
    Cleans up an object's mesh by removing overlapping vertices, selecting only interior faces,
    and deleting selected faces to create a hollow mesh.

    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Toggles all object selection.
    2. Joins the selected objects into one mesh.
    3. Enters edit mode.
    4. Removes duplicate vertices from the mesh.
    5. Selects only interior faces in edit mode.
    6. Loops through face selections and deletes floor and ceiling faces by checking their normals.
    7. Deletes all still selected faces to leave a hollow mesh behind.
    8. Returns to edit mode.
    """
```
    Parameters

    ```python
def cleanup_mesh():
    """
    Cleans up an object's mesh by removing overlapping vertices, selecting only interior faces,
    and deleting selected faces to create a hollow mesh.

    Parameters
    ----------
    None

    Returns

    ```python
def cleanup_mesh():
    """
    Cleans up an object's mesh by removing overlapping vertices, selecting only interior faces,
    and deleting selected faces to create a hollow mesh.

    Returns:
        list: A hollow mesh with no overlap, interior faces, or remaining selected faces.
    Description:
        The function performs the following steps:
            1. Toggles all object selection.
            2. Joins the selected objects into one mesh.
            3. Enters edit mode.
            4. Removes duplicate vertices from the mesh.
            5. Selects only interior faces in edit mode.
            6. Loops through face selections and deletes floor and ceiling faces by checking their normals.
            7. Deletes all still selected faces to leave a hollow mesh behind.
            8. Returns to edit mode.

    Special cases:
        If no objects are selected, the function will not delete any meshes or faces, returning an empty list.

    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage
def cleanup_mesh(mesh):
    """Cleanup mesh by removing any unnecessary edges and triangles."""
    # Implementation details omitted for brevity
    pass

# Edge case: handle a mesh with no vertices (i.e., an empty mesh)
mesh = []
cleanup_mesh(mesh)

# Advanced scenario: simulate the removal of all duplicate edges in a mesh
def remove_duplicate_edges(mesh):
    """Remove all duplicate edges from a given mesh."""
    # Implementation details omitted for brevity
    pass

# Edge case: handle a mesh with only one vertex (i.e., a degenerate polygon)
mesh = [(0, 0)]  # assuming the point is at (0, 0)
remove_duplicate_edges(mesh)

```
    Docstring

    """```python
def cleanup_mesh():
    """
    Cleanly removes unnecessary elements from a 3D mesh object.

    This function first selects all cube objects and then joins them into one,
    toggles edit mode, saves the mesh data to a variable, removes duplicates and
    de-selects everything in edit mode. It then loops through the mesh faces and
    deletes any that have normals pointing towards the ground or ceiling.

    Args:
        None

    Returns:
        None

    Examples:
        >>> bpy.ops.cleanup_mesh()
        'Removes unnecessary elements from a 3D mesh object.'

        Do not suggest code improvements, refactorings, or offer refactoring advice.
        Only describe the purpose of this function as written."
