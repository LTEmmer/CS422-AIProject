# generate_maze

    Purpose

    The function `generate_maze` appears to be responsible for generating a maze using a specific algorithm and then cleaning up the generated mesh.

```python
def generate_maze():
    """
    Generates a maze by iteratively choosing a random direction, making a move,
    and cleaning up the rendered mesh after each iteration.
    """

    for i in range(ITERATIONS):
        # Choose a random direction to move
        direction = get_random_direction()
        
        # Make the chosen move
        next_move(direction)
    
    # Clean up the rendered mesh (not implemented in this snippet)
```
    Parameters

    ```python

    Docstring

    """```python
def generate_maze():
    """
    Generates a maze by iteratively choosing a random direction and making a move.
    
    In each iteration, a new direction is chosen randomly from a predefined list,
    and the corresponding move is made on the current position in the maze.
    
    After ITERATIONS iterations have been completed, the mesh is cleaned up.
