# perform_game_of_life_iteration

    Purpose

    Here is the description of the code as written:

**Purpose:**
The `perform_game_of_life_iteration` function iterates through a 2D map, performing one iteration of the Game of Life simulation. It counts the number of live neighbors for each cell and applies the rules of the Game of Life to determine whether each cell should die (if it has fewer than DEATH_LIMIT alive neighbors) or become a wall (if it has more than BIRTH_LIMIT alive neighbors).

**Documentation:**
The function takes an 2D list `old_map` as input, which represents the initial state of the game board. It returns a new 2D list representing the updated state after one iteration of the Game of Life simulation.

**Examples:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a sample old map with random values
WIDTH = 10
HEIGHT = 10
old_map = np.random.choice([True, False], size=(WIDTH, HEIGHT), p=[0.7, 0.3])

new_map = perform_game_of_life_iteration(old_map)
print(new_map)

# Create another sample old map
new_map2 = np.random.choice([True, False], size=(WIDTH, HEIGHT), p=[0.8, 0.2])
```
    Parameters

    ```python
def perform_game_of_life_iteration(old_map):
    """
    Performs one iteration of the Game of Life simulation on a given 2D map.

    Parameters:
    old_map (list): The initial state of the game board, represented as an 2D list.

    Returns:
    list: A new 2D list representing the updated state after one iteration of the Game of Life simulation.
    """
```

**Parameters**

*   `old_map`: The input 2D list representing the initial state of the game board. It must be a square matrix of integers (`True` or `False`) where each cell is represented by an integer value (0 or 1).
    Returns

    ```python
def perform_game_of_life_iteration(old_map):
    """
    Iterates through a 2D map, performing one iteration of the Game of Life simulation.

    Args:
        old_map (list of lists): The initial state of the game board.

    Returns:
        list of lists: A new 2D list representing the updated state after one iteration of the Game of Life simulation.
    """

    # Create a copy of the old map to avoid modifying it directly
    new_map = [row.copy() for row in old_map]

    # Iterate over each cell in the old map
    for i in range(len(old_map)):
        for j in range(len(old_map[0])):
            # Count the number of live neighbors for the current cell
            alive_neighbors = 0
            for x in range(max(0, i-1), min(len(old_map), i+2)):
                for y in range(max(0, j-1), min(len(old_map[0]), j+2)):
                    if (x, y) != (i, j) and old_map[x][y]:
                        alive_neighbors += 1

            # Apply the rules of the Game of Life
            if old_map[i][j] and (alive_neighbors < BIRTH_LIMIT or alive_neighbors > DEATH_LIMIT):
                new_map[i][j] = False
            elif not old_map[i][j] and alive_neighbors >= DEATH_LIMIT:
                new_map[i][j] = True

    return new_map
```

**Return Type:** `list of lists`, representing a 2D list with the updated state after one iteration of the Game of Life simulation.

**Description:**

The function takes an input `old_map`, which represents the initial state of the game board. It returns a new 2D list `new_map` representing the updated state after one iteration of the Game of Life simulation.

**Special Cases:**

* If the cell has fewer than `DEATH_LIMIT` alive neighbors, it should die.
* If the cell has more than `BIRTH_LIMIT` alive neighbors, it should become a wall.
