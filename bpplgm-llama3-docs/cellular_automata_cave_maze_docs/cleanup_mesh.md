# cleanup_mesh

    Purpose

    ```python
def cleanup_mesh():
    """
    This function cleans up a 3D object by removing and deleting vertices, faces, and normal checks,
    and selecting only the interior faces.

    It iterates through each face of the mesh, checks its normal vector to determine if it should be
    kept or deleted, and then deletes any selected faces that have a positive or negative z-component.
    """
