# initialize_map

    Purpose

    The purpose of this function is to create a 2D map with a specified width and height, initialized as all alive cells initially. The map is represented as a 2D list of boolean values, where True represents an alive cell and False represents an empty space.

```python
def initialize_map():
    initial_map = [[alive_calc() for i in range(WIDTH)] for j in range(HEIGHT)]
    return initial_map
```

**Example usage:**
```python
initial_map = initialize_map()
for row in initial_map:
    print(row)
```
This would output a 2D list representing the initialized map, with all rows initialized as empty spaces and all cells evaluated to True by `alive_calc()`.
    Parameters

    ```
