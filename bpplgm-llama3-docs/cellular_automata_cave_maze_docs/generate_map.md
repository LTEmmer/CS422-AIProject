    Purpose

    ```python
def generate_map():
    """
    Creates and returns an initialized, random cell map for the Game of Life simulation.

    The map is created by initializing a new level_map with random values. It is then iteratively updated 
    through the Game of Life simulation for a set number of steps.

    # Create a new level_map
    # Set up the level_map with random values

    cellmap = initialize_map()  # Initialize an empty map
    # run the simulation for a set number of steps

        cellmap = perform_game_of_life_iteration(cellmap)  # Update the cell map through the Game of Life iteration

A one-line description: Generates a fully iterated representation of a level map using the Game of Life rules.

Args:
  * `cellmap`: A new level_map created with random values. (Description: An instance of the initial level map, which is used as the starting point for the simulation.)
  * `NUMBER_OF_ITERATIONS`: The number of steps to run the simulation for. (Description: An integer specifying how many times the Game of Life iteration should be performed.)
Returns:
  * `cellmap`: A fully iterated representation of the level map, which represents a state that has been fully simulated according to the Game of Life rules. (Description: The final state of the level map, after running the specified number of iterations and applying the Game of Life rules in each step.)

Examples:
```python
>>> cellmap = generate_map()
>>> print(cellmap)
```
In this example, `generate_map` is called to create a new level map (`cellmap`) and run the Game of Life iteration for 10 steps. The resulting `cellmap` is then printed to the console."""
