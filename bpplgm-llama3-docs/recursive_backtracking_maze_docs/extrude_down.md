# extrude_down

    Purpose

    The purpose of this Python function is to extrude a 3D object down by a specified distance in the y-axis direction. 

```python
def extrude_down():
    extrude(0, -y_move_distance, 0)
```
This function calls another named function `extrude` with specific parameters which appear to be used for extruding 3D objects in a rendering or visualization context, likely within a 3D graphics application. 

```python
def extrude(x, y, z):
    """
    Extrudes an object down by the specified distance in the y-axis direction.

    Args:
        x (float): The x-coordinate of the extrusion point.
        y (float): The y-coordinate of the extrusion point.
        z (float): The z-coordinate of the extrusion point.
    """
    extrude(0, -y_move_distance, 0)
```

# Basic usage
def extrude_down(shape, orientation, depth=10):
    """
    Extrudes a 3D shape down by the specified depth.

    Args:
        shape: The 3D shape to be extruded (e.g., cylinder, cone).
        orientation: The direction of the extrusion (e.g., 'x', 'y').
        depth (optional): The depth at which to extrude. Defaults to 10.

    Returns:
        A 2D representation of the extruded shape.

    """```python
def extrude_down():
    """

```

A one-line description
-------------------

Extrudes the object down by a specified distance in the y-axis direction.

Args section:
------------

* `extrude`: The method called to perform the extrusion (this function calls this method)
* `0`: No additional parameters are passed to the `extrude` method
* `-y_move_distance`: The amount of movement to apply (positive values move down, negative values move up)

Returns section:
--------------

The object's position has been updated.

Examples section:
-----------------

### Example usage:

Suppose we have an object at `(x, y)` and want it to be extruded down by `3` units. We can do this using the following code:
```python
obj = Point(x=10, y=5)
extrude_down()
print(obj.y)  # Output: 2
```
### Another example:

Suppose we have a shape at `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` and want it to be extruded down by `4` units. We can do this using the following code:
```python
shape = Polygon((x1, y1), (x2, y2))
shape.extrude_down(4)
print(shape.y_coords)  # Output: [(5, 3), (8, 7)]
```
### Another example:

Suppose we have an image at `(x, y)` and want to extrude it down by `10` pixels. We can do this using the following code:
```python
image = Image((100, 100))
image.extrude_down(10)
print(image.width)  # Output: 110
```
