    Parameters

    ```python
def generate_level():
    """
    The main function responsible for generating a maze level.

    This function simulates the movement of the maze's cells until it reaches all reachable neighboring cells.

    Parameters:
    None

    Returns:
    None

    Notes:
    - None
```

Currently, the `generate_level` function does not take any parameters. 

### Function Purpose:

This function generates a level for a given maze by simulating its movement of cells until all reachable neighboring cells have been visited.

### Documentation:

- **Name:** generate_level
- **Type:** None (this is a function)
- **Description:** The main function responsible for generating a maze level.
- **Usage Constraints:**
    - No usage constraints are specified in this code snippet.
    Returns

    This function simulates the movement of the maze's cells until it reaches all reachable neighboring cells.

    Returns:
        A list containing the return value, which is an empty list if no cell was visited during level generation.

        elif done:  # If all cells have been visited and no more moves can be made, exit the level generation process
            return []
```
    Return Type:
        list
    Description:
        An empty list indicating that no cell was visited during level generation.

    Special Cases:

- If no unvisited neighboring cell is found to move to in the current iteration, the loop exits and returns an empty list.
- If a new unvisited neighbor is found after attempting all moves, it continues with level generation.
    Examples

    ```python
def generate_level(level_name: str) -> None:
    """
    Generates a level with the specified name.

    Args:
        level_name (str): The name of the level to be generated. This is case-sensitive.

    Returns:
        None
    """

    # Explanation
    print(f"Generating level '{level_name}'")

# Basic usage example
generate_level("Forest")

# Edge case: Attempting to generate a level with an invalid name raises a TypeError
try:
    generate_level(123)  # Assuming '123' is not a valid level name
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)

# Advanced scenario (if applicable): Generating multiple levels in a single execution
generate_level("Cave")

    Docstring

    """```python
def generate_level():
    """
    A long-running loop that generates a maze from scratch.

    The loop continuously selects an unvisited neighboring cell to move to,
    keeps track of the directions the maze has gone, and breaks when all cells are visited.
    This ensures that no faces (or edges) are selected in the generated maze.
