# next_mesh_move

    Purpose

    ## Purpose of the Code

This Python function calculates and updates mesh faces in a 3D modeling software, particularly for selecting faces to be extruded. It iterates over each face in the `mesh` object, checks specific conditions based on its normal vector's properties (x or y coordinates), and adds new faces with specified parameters to the `next_face` variable.

## Documentation of Existing Functionality

The function takes a single argument `direction`, which is one of four directions ('up', 'right', 'down', or 'left'). Based on this direction, it iterates over each face in the `mesh` object and updates its select state. It then calls other functions (`extrude_up()`, `extrude_down()`, `extrude_right()`, and `extrude_left()`) to perform the corresponding extrusions.

The function also appends a new direction to the `direction_stack` list, which is used for future use when an extrusion needs to be performed in a different direction. The `next_face` variable keeps track of the face that should be selected for the next extrusion.

## Examples

To update faces based on the 'up' direction:
```python
mesh.faces = [face for face in mesh.faces if face.select]
next_mesh_move('up')
```

To update faces based on the 'right' direction:
```python
mesh.faces = [face for face in mesh.faces if face.normal.x == 1.0 and round(face.calc_center_median()[0], 2) == x_pos]
next_mesh_move('right')
```

Note that these examples assume that `x_pos` and `y_pos` are defined elsewhere in the code, and that `direction_stack` is also defined and populated correctly before calling `next_mesh_move()`.

```python
mesh.faces = [face for face in mesh.faces if face.normal.x == 1.0 and round(face.calc_center_median()[0], 2) == x_pos]
next_mesh_move('right')
