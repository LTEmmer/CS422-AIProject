# extrude_up

    Purpose

    This function appears to be a part of a class-based program that likely handles 3D modeling and rendering operations. The function `extrude` is called with three arguments: `y_move_distance`, which specifies the distance up from the origin (usually the bottom or top edge of an extruded object), and `0` as its value, which typically means the extrusion should start at the origin point.

The function also includes a default value for the `extrude` method, which is called with argument `(y_move_distance,)`, indicating that this method can be used to create extrusions without specifying any additional arguments.
    Parameters

    ```python
def extrude_up(y_move_distance=0):

# Parameters
extrude_up(
    y_move_distance=0,
    # The name of the parameter.
    default=0,
    # A description of the parameter's purpose.
    help="The distance up from the origin (usually the bottom or top edge of an extruded object)."
)

```python
# Usage constraints
# Note that this function does not take any arguments explicitly.
# The first argument, y_move_distance, has a default value and must be non-negative.
# The second argument, 0, is used as a default value for the 'extrude' method.
```
    Returns

    ```python

    """
    Return value for 'extrude_up': The result of calling the extrude method with y_move_distance as its only argument.

    Description:
        This function appears to be a part of a class-based program that likely handles 3D modeling and rendering operations.
        It returns the result of calling the extrude method, which is responsible for creating an object by extruding it along the specified axis.

    Special cases:

        When y_move_distance is not provided (default: 0), the function calls the default extrude method with no arguments.
        In this case, the extruded object will start at the origin point (usually the bottom or top edge of an extruded object).

    # Return type
    return None

# Example usage:
extrude_up()  # Output: None

# Define a default extrude method that returns its result with y_move_distance=0
def default_extrude_method(y_move_distance):
    return "Default Extrusion Result"

# Call the default extrude method and pass y_move_distance as an argument
print(default_extrude_method(10))  # Output: Default Extrusion Result

extrude_up(5)  # Output: <extruded object>
```

Note: The `None` return value for 'extrude_up' is based on the provided documentation and does not contain any actual code.
