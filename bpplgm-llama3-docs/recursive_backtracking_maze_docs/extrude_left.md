# extrude_left

    Purpose

    This function is a part of a simulation where it applies an extrusion movement to the specified axis (-x-axis) by a certain distance (defined by `x_move_distance`). 

```python
def extrude_left():
    extrude(-x_move_distance, 0, 0)
```
Note: There is no function definition for the `extrude` method in this snippet. It seems like it's calling another function called `extrude`.
    Parameters

    ```python
def extrude_left():
    """
    Applies an extrusion movement to the specified axis (-x-axis) by a certain distance (defined by `x_move_distance`).
    
    This function calls another method, likely in a parent class or module, which is responsible for the actual extrusion movement.
    The purpose of this function is to define how far and how on which axis an extrusion will be applied.

    Parameters
    ----------
    None

    Returns
    -------
    None

```
    Returns

    ```python
def extrude_left():
    """
    Applies an extrusion movement to the specified axis (-x-axis) by a certain distance (defined by `x_move_distance`).
    
    Returns:
        list: An empty list, as there are no return statements in this function.
        
    Description:
        This function simulates an extrusion movement along the -x axis. It moves the object to the right by the specified distance.

    Special cases:
        None
