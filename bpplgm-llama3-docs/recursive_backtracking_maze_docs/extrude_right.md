# extrude_right

    Purpose

    The function `extrude_right` is a part of a larger system that appears to be designed for rendering or modeling three-dimensional objects in some context. Specifically, it defines an action that can be executed by moving an object along the x-axis and then extruding it (projecting) outwards.

```python
def extrude_right():
    extrude(x_move_distance, 0.0, 0)
```

This function calls another function named `extrude` with three arguments: `x_move_distance`, `0.0`, and `0`.
    Parameters

    ```python
def extrude_right(
    # No parameters are specified for this function.
)
```

### Function Purpose

The `extrude_right` function is a part of a larger system that appears to be designed for rendering or modeling three-dimensional objects in some context. Specifically, it defines an action that can be executed by moving an object along the x-axis and then extruding it (projecting) outwards.

### Parameters

None
```python
x_move_distance: float,  # The distance the object moves along the x-axis before extruding.
0.0: float,  # The initial position of the extruded object along the z-axis.
0.0: float,  # Any other parameters not used in this function.
```

### Usage Constraints

None
```python
# This function calls another function named `extrude` with three arguments:
#   - x_move_distance: A float representing the distance the object moves along the x-axis.
#   - 0.0: A float representing the initial position of the extruded object along the z-axis.
#   - 0.0: A float representing any other parameters not used in this function.
