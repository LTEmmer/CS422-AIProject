# move_back

    Purpose

    The purpose of this function is to move the character back by a specified distance in a specified direction. 

```python
def move_back():
    """
    Move the character back by a specified distance in a specified direction.

    The direction can be 'up', 'right', 'down', or 'left'. The character will move 
    back by twice its current position value relative to the current direction.
    
    Parameters:
    None

    Returns:
    None
