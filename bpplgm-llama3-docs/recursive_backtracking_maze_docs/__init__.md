# __init__

    Purpose

    This function is used to initialize a cell in a grid or matrix data structure with its respective coordinates (row and column) and flag indicating whether it has been visited yet. 

```python
def __init__(self, x, y):
    self.x = x  # cell's row position
    self.y = y  # cell's column position
    self.visited = False
```

This function takes two parameters `x` and `y`, representing the coordinates of a cell in a grid or matrix. It initializes these attributes as follows: `self.x` is set to `x` (the row position), `self.y` is set to `y` (the column position), and sets `self.visited` to `False`.
    Parameters

    ```
def __init__(self, x: int, y: int) -> None:
    """
    Initializes a cell in a grid or matrix data structure with its respective coordinates (row and column) and flag indicating whether it has been visited yet.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : int
        The row position of the cell.
    y : int
        The column position of the cell.

    Returns
    -------
    None

    Usage Constraints:
    - Two integer arguments, `x` and `y`, are required to initialize a cell in the grid or matrix data structure.
