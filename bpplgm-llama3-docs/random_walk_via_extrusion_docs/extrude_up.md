# extrude_up

    Purpose

    The given function appears to be a part of a 3D modeling or animation system, specifically designed to extrude (or extend) a shape up by a specified distance along the Y-axis. The purpose of this function is to create an upward extension of the original object, moving it away from its current position.

```python
def extrude_up():
    extrude(0, y_move_distance, 0)
```

```python
extrude(0, y_move_distance, 0)  # This line extends the object up by y_move_distance units starting from (0, 0, 0)
```

This line calls the `extrude` function with three parameters: an initial position `(0, 0, 0)`, and two movement variables: `y_move_distance` for the Y-axis and `0` for both X-axis and Z-axis.
    Parameters

    ```python
def extrude_up():
    """
    The 'extrude_up' function appears to be a part of a 3D modeling or animation system,
    specifically designed to extrude (or extend) a shape up by a specified distance along the Y-axis.

    Parameters:
    None

    Description:
    Creates an upward extension of the original object, moving it away from its current position.
    The 'extrude_up' function uses the given parameters to specify the initial position,
    and two movement variables: y_move_distance for the Y-axis and 0 for both X-axis and Z-axis.

    Usage Constraints:
    None

    Returns

    ```python
def extrude_up():
    """
    Extends a 3D object up by y_move_distance units starting from (0, 0, 0).

    Returns:
        str: None (the function does not return any value)

    Description:
        The `extrude_up` function appears to be part of a 3D modeling or animation system,
        specifically designed to extrude (or extend) an object up by a specified distance
        along the Y-axis. It creates an upward extension of the original object, moving it away from its current position.

    Special cases:
        The `extrude_up` function is called with no initial position and movement variables.
```

```python
extrude(0, y_move_distance, 0)  # This line extends the object up by y_move_distance units starting from (0, 0, 0)
```

```python
def extrude(y_move_distance):
    """
    Extends a 3D object up by specified distance along Y-axis.

    Returns:
        str: None (the function does not return any value)

    Description:
        The `extrude` function appears to be part of a 3D modeling or animation system,
        specifically designed to extrude an object up by a specified distance along the Y-axis.
        It creates an upward extension of the original object, moving it away from its current position.

    Special cases:
        When called without an initial position and movement variables (e.g., calling `extrude(0)`),
            the function extends the object up by the specified `y_move_distance` units,
            starting from a position of (0, 0, 0).
