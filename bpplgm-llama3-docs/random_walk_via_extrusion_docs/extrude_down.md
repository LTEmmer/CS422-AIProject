# extrude_down

    Purpose

    This function is designed to apply a downward extrusion transformation to an object in a 3D space by moving it down by a specified distance in the negative y-axis.

```
def extrude_down():
    """
    Applies a downward extrusion transformation to an object in 3D space.
    
    The transformation moves the object down by a specified distance in the negative y-axis.

    Parameters:
    None

    Returns:
    None

extrude(0, -y_move_distance, 0)

    Parameters

    ```python
def extrude_down():
    """
    Applies a downward extrusion transformation to an object in 3D space.
    
    The transformation moves the object down by a specified distance in the negative y-axis.

    Parameters:
    None
    
    Returns:
    None
    
    Notes:
    - This function does not take any parameters, indicating it requires no input arguments.
    - It modifies the object's position and orientation without returning a value or modifying external variables.
    - The transformation is applied to the object with default values, meaning it remains unchanged if called with empty keyword arguments.

    Returns

    ```python
def extrude_down():
    """
    Applies a downward extrusion transformation to an object in 3D space.

    The transformation moves the object down by a specified distance in the negative y-axis.

    Parameters:
    None

    Returns:
    None

    Description:
        This function applies a downward extrusion transformation to an object in 3D space.
        It moves the object down by a specified distance in the negative y-axis.
        The distance is specified as the first parameter, which should be a positive value.

    Special cases:

        If no distance is provided (i.e., `y_move_distance` is not defined), 
        the function will move the object up instead of down.

    ```python
# Basic usage
def extrude_down(image, thickness=1):
    """
    Extrudes the down from an image by a specified amount.

    Parameters:
    image (numpy.ndarray): The input image to be modified.
    thickness (int, optional): The distance to extrude. Defaults to 1.

    Returns:
    numpy.ndarray: The modified image with down extrusion.

```python
# Edge case: Zero thickness
def extrude_down(image, zero_thickness=0):
    """
    Extrudes the down from an image by a specified amount.

    Parameters:
    image (numpy.ndarray): The input image to be modified.
    zero_thickness (int, optional): The distance to extrude. Defaults to 0.

    Returns:
    numpy.ndarray: The modified image with extruded down.

# Advanced scenario: Extruding down on both sides of an edge
def extrude_down(image, edge_width=1):

    Extrudes the down from an image by specified amounts on both sides of an edge.

    Parameters:
    image (numpy.ndarray): The input image to be modified.
    edge_width (int, optional): The distance between each extrusion. Defaults to 1.

    Returns:
    numpy.ndarray: The modified image with down extrusions on both sides of the edges.
