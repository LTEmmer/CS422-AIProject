# extrude_left

    Purpose

    The purpose of this function is to extrude a 3D object in the x-direction by moving it leftward by a specified distance.

```python
def extrude_left(x_move_distance):
    """
    Extrudes a 3D object in the x-direction by moving it leftward by a specified distance.
    
    Parameters:
        x_move_distance (float): The distance to move the object in the x-direction.
        
    Returns:
        None
    """
    extrude(-x_move_distance, 0, 0)
```
    Parameters

    ```python
def extrude_left(x_move_distance):
    """
    Extrudes a 3D object in the x-direction by moving it leftward by a specified distance.

    Parameters:
        x_move_distance (float): The distance to move the object in the x-direction.
        
    Returns:
        None
    """
    
    # The function calls another function 'extrude' with three arguments: x_position, y_position, and z_position. 
    # The first two arguments are set to 0 to maintain the original orientation of the object. 
    # The third argument is the specified distance to move in the x-direction.
    extrude(-x_move_distance, 0, 0)
```
    Returns

    ```python
def extrude_left(x_move_distance):
    """
    Extrudes a 3D object in the x-direction by moving it leftward by a specified distance.

    Parameters:
        x_move_distance (float): The distance to move the object in the x-direction.

    Returns:
        None

    Description:
        This function uses the 'extrude' geometry operation to create a new 3D object, 
        extruding an existing object in the x-direction by moving it leftward by the specified distance.

    Special cases:
        If x_move_distance is not provided (i.e., the input is None or 0), 
        the function calls 'extrude' with no arguments, effectively leaving the object unchanged.
    """
    # Return type: None
    # Description: The 'extrude_left' function returns nothing, as it modifies an existing geometry object directly.
    # Special cases:
    #     - x_move_distance is not provided (None or 0), in which case it calls extrude with no arguments.
```

```python
# Example usage:
print(extrude_left(5))  # Extrudes an object in the x-direction by moving it leftward by 5 units.
print(extrude_left(None))  # Prints nothing, as this is equivalent to calling extrude with no arguments.
```
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage
def extrude_left(x, y, z, radius):
    """
    Extrudes a line from the given point to create an offset.

    Args:
        x (float): The initial x-coordinate.
        y (float): The initial y-coordinate.
        z (float): The initial z-coordinate.
        radius (float): The distance to extrude.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the new coordinates after extrusion.
    """
    return x + radius, y - radius, z

# Edge case
def extrude_left_edge_case(x):
    """
    Extrudes a line from the given point to create an offset along the X-axis.

# Advanced scenario
def extrude_left_advanced_scenario(x, y):
    """
