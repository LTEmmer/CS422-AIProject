# extrude

    Purpose

    **Purpose of the Function**

The `extrude` function in this code appears to be used for creating a 3D extruded object by extruding from an initial point (x, y, z) in a specified direction and with a specified orientation.

**Functionality Documentation**

This function takes three parameters: 
- `x`: The x-coordinate of the starting point.
- `y`: The y-coordinate of the starting point.
- `z`: The z-coordinate of the starting point.

It uses the Blender Python API (bpy) to perform an extrusion operation.
    Parameters

def extrude(x: float, y: float, z: float) -> object:

    # Return type: bpy.context.object
    # Description: The return value is the newly created 3D extruded object.
    # Special cases: None or an empty list are returned when no extrusion operation is performed.

    # Examples:
    # result = extrude(0, 1, -2)  # Extrudes a cube with edge length 10 units
    # print(result.get('object', 'None'))  # Output: bpy.context.object

    """```python
"""
Moves a 3D extruded mesh region by specified amounts in x, y, and z directions.

This function uses Blender's built-in `mesh.extrude_region_move` and `transform.translate`
functions to move the entire extruded mesh region. It also applies a translation along
the global axes to the object being moved, if needed.

Args:
    x (float): Amount to translate in the x direction.
    y (float): Amount to translate in the y direction.
    z (float): Amount to translate in the z direction.

Returns:
    None
