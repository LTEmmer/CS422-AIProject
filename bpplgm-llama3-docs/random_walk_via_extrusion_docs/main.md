    ```python

    # This is achieved by setting the 'select' attribute of each face to False
    for f in mesh.faces:
        f.select = False

        direction = get_random_direction()
        # Move the next mesh based on the generated direction
        next_mesh_move(direction)
        # Append the current (x, y) coordinates to the visited_list
        visited_list.append((x_pos, y_pos))
    # Perform cleanup operations after the iteration is complete
    cleanup()

def get_random_direction():
    """
    Returns a random direction in 2D space.

    The function generates a random vector by first generating two random numbers between -1 and 1.
    These two numbers are then used to calculate the x and y components of the direction vector, which can be considered as a random angle between 0 and 360 degrees (i.e., 0 to 2π radians) in radians.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the x and y components of the generated direction.

    import random
    return (random.uniform(-1, 1), random.uniform(-1, 1))

    Performs any necessary cleanup operations after the iteration is complete.
    These may include resetting the mesh faces or other relevant data structures.

    Returns:
