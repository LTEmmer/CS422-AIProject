# cleanup_mesh

    Purpose

    `The `cleanup_mesh` function is designed to simplify the process of cleaning up a 3D object mesh by selecting all objects, joining them together, removing duplicates, and then de-selecting everything in edit mode before returning the cleaned-up mesh data.
    Parameters

    ```

**Function Purpose:**
The `cleanup_mesh` function is designed to simplify the process of cleaning up a 3D object mesh by selecting all objects, joining them together, removing duplicates, and then de-selecting everything in edit mode before returning the cleaned-up mesh data.

**Return Type:** A list containing the cleaned-up mesh data. The actual structure and content of this list may vary depending on the input.

**Special Cases:**
There are no special cases that affect the operation of this function, as it does not return any value when executed successfully.

A one-line description of the function:

```python
Cleans and optimizes a 3D mesh object by removing overlaps.
```

Args section with parameter details:

* `bpy.context.object`: The current active 3D object being manipulated. (Type: `MeshObject`)
* `mesh`: A reference to the original mesh data. (Type: ` bpy.data.meshes`)

Returns section with return value details:

* `mesh`: A copy of the cleaned-up mesh data, used for later reference. (Type: `bpy.data.meshes.MeshData`)

Examples section showing usage:

```python
# Clean up a simple cube mesh
cleanup_mesh()

# Create a new cube mesh and clean it up
obj = bpy.data.objects['Cube']
mesh = obj.data
mesh.clear()
cleanup_mesh()
```
Note: The example code is not provided as it does not require the mesh to be cleaned."""
