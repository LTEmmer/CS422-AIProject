# clear_scene

    Purpose

    ## Purpose of the `clear_scene` Function
The `clear_scene` function is designed to clear and delete an object from a 3D modeling scene in Blender using Python API.

## Documentation of Existing Functionality
This code snippet defines a Python function named `clear_scene` that takes no arguments. It first checks if an active object exists within the current Blender scene context. If such an object does exist, it then verifies whether the selected object's mode is not set to 'OBJECT' and switches its mode accordingly. Finally, it selects all objects in the scene, deletes them using `bpy.ops.object.delete`, and disables global selection.

## Examples of Usage
To use this function, simply call it from another Python script or function within a Blender context, as demonstrated by its usage in the provided snippet:
    Parameters

    Here is the documented `clear_scene` function:

```python
def clear_scene():
    """
