# generate

    Purpose

    ## Purpose of the `generate` method

The `generate` method is responsible for populating a 2D grid map with rooms, connecting them to form staircases and walls, and placing geometry objects at specific locations.

* It initializes two empty lists: `map` and `rooms`, which will be used to store the grid's cells and room data respectively.
* It sets up the grid's structure by populating each cell with an initial value, indicating whether it is a light source (0) or not (1).
* It randomly selects `num_rooms` rooms within the specified range and places them in the map, ensuring that no two rooms collide.
* If a room would overlap with an existing room, it is skipped.
* The method then shrinks the map by setting all adjacent cells to 1 (indicating they are walls), except for the first `connected` cell, which remains at 0 (light).
* It finds the closest non-adjacent room among connected rooms and connects them with a staircase if possible.
* Finally, it marks staircases and places geometry objects (rooms) at specific locations within the map.

## Documentation of existing functionality

The `generate` method performs the following steps:

1. Initializes the grid's structure by populating each cell with an initial value (light or not).
2. Randomly selects rooms within a specified range and places them in the map, ensuring that no two rooms collide.
3. Shrinks the map by setting all adjacent cells to 1 (walls), except for the first connected room.
4. Finds the closest non-adjacent room among connected rooms and connects them with staircases if possible.
5. Marks staircases and places geometry objects at specific locations within the map.

Note: This documentation only covers the existing functionality of the `generate` method as presented in the code snippet, without attempting to suggest improvements or refactoring advice.
