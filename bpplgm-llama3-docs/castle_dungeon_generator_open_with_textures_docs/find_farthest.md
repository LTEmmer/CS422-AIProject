# find_farthest

    Purpose

    The purpose of the given Python function is to find the pair of rooms in a list of rooms that are farthest apart from each other.

This function iterates over all possible pairs of rooms in the input list and calculates the Manhattan distance (a measure of the distance between two points) between each pair. The room with the largest Manhattan distance is selected as the farthest pair, which is then stored in `self.first_room` and `self.last_room`.
    Parameters

    ```python
def find_farthest(self):
    """
    Find the pair of rooms in a list of rooms that are farthest apart from each other.

    This function iterates over all possible pairs of rooms in the input list and calculates the Manhattan distance (a measure of the distance between two points) 
    between each pair. The room with the largest Manhattan distance is selected as the farthest pair, which is then stored in `self.first_room` and `self.last_room`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    self : object
        The instance of a class containing this function.

    Returns
    -------
    None

    Notes
    -----
    This function has no return value. It modifies the input list by storing the farthest pair of rooms in `self.first_room` and `self.last_room`.

One-line description: Finds the rooms with the largest Euclidean distance.

Args section:

* `self.rooms`: A list of room objects to search through.
Returns section:

* `swap_room`: The maximum distance between two rooms in a pair.
Examples section:

* Use the function like this:
```python
rooms = [...]
farthest_pair = find_farthest(rooms)
print(farthest_pair.first_room, farthest_pair.last_room)
```
Note: This code assumes that the `rooms` list contains room objects with 'x', 'y', and 'w' attributes representing their positions."""
