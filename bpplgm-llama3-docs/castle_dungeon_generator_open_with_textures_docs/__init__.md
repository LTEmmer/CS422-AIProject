# __init__

    Purpose

    This Python function initializes the properties of a room management system, including room sizes, numbers of rooms and connected rooms, stairs, lights, and other attributes. 

```python
def __init__(self):
```

Self is the first parameter in this case, indicating that this is an instance method (i.e., it's designed to create or manage instances of a class).

The function initializes the properties with various integer values for room sizes and numbers of rooms, as well as several empty lists (rooms, stairs, connected rooms) and single variables (light).
    Parameters

    ```python
def __init__(self):
    """
    Initializes the properties of a room management system.

    Parameters:
        None

    Description:
        This function initializes the properties with various integer values for room sizes and numbers of rooms,
        as well as several empty lists (rooms, stairs, connected rooms) and single variables (light).

    Usage Constraints:
        None

    Returns

    ```python
def __init__(self):
    """
    Initializes the properties of a room management system.

    This method initializes various attributes for the room management system,
    including:
    - Room sizes: integer values representing the size of each room.
    - Number of rooms: an integer value indicating the total number of rooms in the system.
    - Connected rooms: empty list to store connected room IDs.
    - Stairs: empty list to store stair IDs and their positions.
    - Lights: single variable (light) to store a boolean flag indicating whether a light is present.

    Returns:
        None

    ```python
# Basic usage

person1 = Person("Bob")
person2 = Person("Charlie")

print(person1.name)  # Explanation
code = person1.name  # Output: Bob

# Advanced scenario (if applicable)
def calculate_area(length, width):
    """Calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width."""
    return length * width

area = calculate_area(4, 5)

    """```python
def __init__(self):

    Initializes a RoomContainer object.

    A RoomContainer is responsible for managing rooms within a larger map. It keeps track of room sizes, connections between rooms,
    and whether light sources are present in each room.

    Attributes:
        x_size (int): The width of the room in map units.
        y_size (int): The height of the room in map units.
        min_room_size (int): The minimum size of a room in map units.
        max_room_size (int): The maximum size of a room in map units.
        num_rooms (int): The total number of rooms in the container. Currently not initialized.
        min_rooms (int): The minimum number of rooms required for a connected area to be considered part of the container. Currently set to 10.
        max_rooms (int): The maximum number of rooms allowed in the container. Currently set to 15.
        map (Map): The underlying map containing the rooms and connections.
        rooms (RoomContainer): A reference to this RoomContainer object.
        first_room (Room): The first room in the container, if any.
        last_room (Room): The last room in the container, if any.
        stairs_up (bool): Whether there is a stairway connecting two rooms. Initially set to None.
        stairs_down (bool): Whether there is a stairway connecting two rooms. Initially set to None.
        connected (bool): A flag indicating whether the rooms are currently connected. Initially set to None.
        light (int): The number of light sources present in each room, starting at 0.

    Returns:
        RoomContainer: An initialized RoomContainer object with the described attributes and connections.
