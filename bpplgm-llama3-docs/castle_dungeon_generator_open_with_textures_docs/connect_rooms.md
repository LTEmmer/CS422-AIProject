    Args:
        room (dict): The current room with 'x', 'y', and 'w' keys representing the room's position.
        closest_room (dict): The closest available room in the same direction as the input room.

    Parameters

    # Description
    # This function connects a given room to its closest neighbor on the map by determining the closest available room in the same direction.
    
    # Parameters
    # ----------
    # room (dict): The current room with 'x', 'y', and 'w' keys representing the room's position.
    #     It is expected that this dictionary has 'x', 'y', and 'w' keys for each coordinate of the room.
    # 
    # closest_room (dict): The closest available room in the same direction as the input room.
    #     It is expected that this dictionary also has 'x', 'y', and 'w' keys representing the position of its corresponding coordinates on the map.
    # 
    # good (bool): A flag indicating whether a connection is desired ('True') or not ('False').
    #     This parameter determines if the room should be connected to another room, i.e., it has value other than False for this key.

    # Usage constraints
    # -------------
    # The 'room' dictionary must have 'x', 'y', and 'w' keys for each coordinate of the room.
    # 
    # The 'closest_room' dictionary also must have 'x', 'y', and 'w' keys representing its corresponding coordinates on the map.
    # 
    # The 'good' parameter is a flag that determines if a connection should be attempted ('True') or not ('False').
    Returns

    ### return value for 'connect_rooms'

*   Type: `None`
*   Description: The function `connect_rooms` returns `None`, indicating that no connections are made to a room with a `good` flag of `False`.
