# point_collide

    Purpose

    The given function, `point_collide`, determines whether two points on a 2D map collide based on the collision detection system provided by the map object. 

```python
def point_collide(self, x, y):
    if self.map[x][y]['t'] == 1:
        return False
    return True
```

This function takes in two arguments, `x` and `y`, which represent the coordinates of a point on the map, and returns `True` if the point collides with another point (as determined by the collision detection system), and `False` otherwise. 

```python
def point_collide(self, x, y):
    if self.map[x][y]['t'] == 1:
        return False
    return True
```

This function is currently defined within a class (not shown in this snippet) that likely represents a game or simulation environment with a map and collision detection system. 

```python
def point_collide(self, x, y):
    if self.map[x][y]['t'] == 1:
        return False
    return True
```

This function does not seem to be taking any additional arguments other than `x` and `y`, suggesting that it will use the provided coordinates directly in its calculation.
    Parameters

    ```python
def point_collide(self, x: int, y: int) -> bool:
    """
    Determines whether two points on a 2D map collide based on the collision detection system provided by the map object.

    Args:
        x (int): The x-coordinate of the first point.
        y (int): The y-coordinate of the second point.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the points collides, False otherwise.
    """
    # Check if the current cell is marked as collision (t=1) and has a valid position
    if self.map[x][y]['t'] == 1:
        return False
    return True
```
    Returns

    ## point_collide Function Documentation

### Return Type

The `point_collide` function returns a boolean value indicating whether two points on a 2D map collide.

### Description

This function determines whether two points on a 2D map collide based on the collision detection system provided by the map object. It checks if a point with coordinates `(x, y)` is colliding with another point (`t` coordinate) at position `x` and `y` in the map's collision detection system.

### Special Cases

* If `t` (collision detection coefficient) for any cell at `(x, y)` is equal to 1, it returns False, indicating that no collision exists.
* Otherwise, it returns True, suggesting that a collision occurs.
    Examples

    ```python
def point_collide(point1, point2):
    """
    Checks if two points are colliding.

    Args:
        point1 (tuple): The coordinates of the first point as a tuple (x, y).
        point2 (tuple): The coordinates of the second point as a tuple (x, y).

    Returns:
        bool: True if the points are colliding, False otherwise.
    """
    # Calculate the distance between the two points
    distance = ((point1[0] - point2[0]) ** 2 + (point1[1] - point2[1]) ** 2) ** 0.5
    
    # If the distance is less than or equal to a certain threshold, the points are colliding
    return distance <= 10


# Basic usage
print(point_collide((0, 0), (1, 1)))  # Expected output: True

# Edge case
try:
    print(point_collide((5, 5), (-2, -3)))
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)  # Expected output: cannot compare float and int objects

# Advanced scenario
print(point_collide((-10, -10), (0, 0)))  # Expected output: True
```
