# place_geometry

    Purpose

    `This function appears to be responsible for placing objects of different shapes and sizes in a 2D maze environment. It iterates over each cell in the maze, adding cubes, spheres, cylinders, and planes as necessary to create walls, beginings, ends, and floor tiles. The placement is determined by the maze map data stored in `self.map`.`

```python
def place_geometry(self):
    yy = 0
    for y in range(self.y_size):
        xx = 0
        for x in range(self.x_size):
            if self.map[y][x]['t'] == 0 or self.map[y][x]['r'] == 0:  # these are not part of the maze body
                pass
            elif self.map[y][x]['t'] == 2:
                # these are the walls
                bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=2, enter_editmode=False, location=(xx, yy, 0))
            elif self.map[y][x]['t'] == 3:
                # this is the beginning
                bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_uv_sphere_add(radius=1, enter_editmode=False, location=(xx, yy, 0))
            elif self.map[y][x]['t'] == 4:
                # this is the end
                bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cylinder_add(radius=1, enter_editmode=False, location=(xx, yy, 0))
            else:
                # these are the floor tiles,
                bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_plane_add(size=2, enter_editmode=False, location=(xx, yy, -1))
            xx += 2
        yy += 2

The parameters of this function are:

*   `self`: The instance of the class containing this function. It is assumed that this object has a 'map' attribute, which is a dictionary representing the maze map data.

The usage constraints for these parameters are as follows:

*   `self.map` must be a valid dictionary.
*   Each key in the dictionary should correspond to a cell in the maze, where the value associated with each key is another dictionary containing information about that cell. The keys 't' and 'r' are assumed to represent type ('0' for not part of the maze body, '1' for wall) and radius ('0' for floor tile), respectively.
*   The values associated with these keys in the inner dictionaries should be one of the following: a size value (e.g., 2 or 3) that determines the size of objects like cubes, spheres, and cylinders; a type value that determines the shape of an object (e.g., 'cylinder' for cylinder-shaped walls); and the 'radius' value, which is required to define floor tiles.
    Returns

    ```python
def place_geometry(self) -> list[str]:
    """
    This function appears to be responsible for placing objects of different shapes and sizes in a 2D maze environment.
    
    It iterates over each cell in the maze, adding cubes, spheres, cylinders, and planes as necessary to create walls, beginnings, ends, and floor tiles.
    
    The placement is determined by the maze map data stored in `self.map`.
    
    Args:
        None
    
    Returns:
        A list of strings indicating whether each object was successfully placed ('placed') or not.
        
        Description:
            The function iterates over each cell in the maze, adding objects as necessary to create walls, beginnings, ends, and floor tiles.
            
            If a cell is part of the body (i.e., its value is 0), it skips that cell. Otherwise, it adds specific objects according to their type and location.
            
            The function then moves to the next cell in the maze and repeats the process.

    Special cases:
        None
```

```python
return [
    # ...
]
```

Description:
The function iterates over each cell in the maze, adding cubes, spheres, cylinders, and planes as necessary to create walls, beginnings, ends, and floor tiles. The placement is determined by the maze map data stored in `self.map`.

Example usage:

```python
# Create a new object with a small cube at position (10, 20)
obj = bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, enter_editmode=False, location=(10, 20))

# Add a sphere to the left of the cube
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_uv_sphere_add(radius=0.5, enter_editmode=False, location=(-9, 18, -1))
```
    Examples

    ```python

    """
