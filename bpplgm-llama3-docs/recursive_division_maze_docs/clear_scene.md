# clear_scene

    Purpose

    This function clears a 3D scene by selecting and deleting all objects in the current view. It uses Blender's Python API to interact with the object selection and deletion functions.

```python
def clear_scene():
    bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')
    bpy.ops.object.delete(use_global=False)
```

The existing functionality can be described as follows:

* The function first selects all objects in the current 3D view using `bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')`.
* Then, it deletes these selected objects using `bpy.ops.object.delete(use_global=False)`, where `use_global=True` indicates that the object deletion will affect all objects on the global hierarchy.
    Parameters

    ```python
def clear_scene():
    """
    Clears a 3D scene by selecting and deleting all objects in the current view.

    This function uses Blender's Python API to interact with the object selection and deletion functions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    None

    Returns
    -------
    None
    """
```

The parameter `[]` indicates that this function does not take any parameters.
    Returns

    ```python
def clear_scene():
    """
    Clears a 3D scene by selecting and deleting all objects in the current view.

    This function uses Blender's Python API to interact with the object selection and deletion functions.
    
    Returns:
        list: An empty list indicating that no return value was yielded or thrown.

    Description:
        The function first selects all objects in the current 3D view using `bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')`.
        Then, it deletes these selected objects using `bpy.ops.object.delete(use_global=False)`, where 
        `use_global=True` indicates that the object deletion will affect all objects on the global hierarchy.

    Special cases:
        - If there are no objects in the current view, an empty list is returned.

        Clears a 3D scene by selecting and deleting all objects.

        This function uses Blender's operator system to select all objects in the scene,
        then deletes them globally. Note that this will delete any object that is
        recursively nested within another object, so be cautious when using with
        complex scenes.
