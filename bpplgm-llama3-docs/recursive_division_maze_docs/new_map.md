# new_map

    Purpose

    The `new_map` function creates a square 2D map of a specified size, where each cell is initialized with the provided `value`. 

```
def new_map(size, value):
    """
    Creates a square 2D map of a specified size, 
    where each cell is initialized with the provided value.

    Args:
        size (int): The size of the map.
        value: The initial value to fill each cell.

    Returns:
        list[list[int]]: A 2D list representing the map.

    Example:
        >>> new_map(3, 'X')
        [[None, None, None], [None, None, None], [None, None, None]]
