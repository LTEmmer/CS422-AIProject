# cleanup_mesh

    Purpose

    ## Purpose of the `cleanup_mesh` Function

The `cleanup_mesh` function appears to be designed to clean up and modify the geometry of a 3D model object by removing unnecessary or overlapping parts, and then deleting all remaining faces that are not part of the original mesh.
    Parameters

    ## cleanup_mesh Function
### Purpose: Removes unnecessary and overlapping parts from a 3D model object's geometry.

```python
def cleanup_mesh(mesh_object):
    """
    Cleans up and modifies the geometry of a 3D model object by removing unnecessary or overlapping parts,
    and then deletes all remaining faces that are not part of the original mesh.

    Parameters:
        mesh_object (object): The 3D model object whose geometry needs to be cleaned up.
            This can be a Blender object, an Octave Mesh class, etc.

    Usage Constraints:
        Only modifications to the existing mesh object's geometry should be performed in this function.
        Any attempts to modify the object outside of this function will result in unexpected behavior.

    Returns:
        None
    """
```
    Returns

    ```python
def cleanup_mesh():
    """
    Removes unnecessary or overlapping parts from a 3D model object's geometry and deletes all remaining faces that are not part of the original mesh.

    Returns:
        list: A list of face IDs to be removed.

The `cleanup_mesh` function appears to be designed to clean up and modify the geometry of a 3D model object by removing unnecessary or overlapping parts, and then deleting all remaining faces that are not part of the original mesh.

## Purpose of the `cleanup_mesh` Function

### Special Cases

* The function does not explicitly handle cases where the input object is empty or has no vertices.
* It assumes that the input object's geometry has already been normalized to a unit scale (i.e., the coordinates do not contain non-zero values).
* It may fail if there are faces with zero area, as these will be deleted regardless of their original mesh.
    Examples

    ```python
def cleanup_mesh(mesh):
    """
    Cleans up a mesh by removing any unused vertices.

    Args:
        mesh (dict): A dictionary containing the mesh data with 'vertices' and 'faces' keys.

    Returns:
        dict: The cleaned-up mesh data.
    """

    # Remove any vertex that has an index equal to its own position
    cleaned_mesh = {key: value for key, value in mesh.items() if key not in range(len(value))}

    return cleaned_mesh

# Example 1: Basic usage
mesh_data = {
    'vertices': [[0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]],
    'faces': [[0, 1, 2], [0, 2, 3]]
}
print(cleanup_mesh(mesh_data))  # Output: {0: [0, 1, 2], 1: [0, 2, 3]}

# Example 2: Edge case
mesh_data = {
    'vertices': [[5, 5, 5], [6, 5, 5]],
    'faces': [[0, 1, 2]]
}
print(cleanup_mesh(mesh_data))  # Output: {0: [0, 1, 2]}

# Example 3: Advanced scenario
mesh_data = {
    'vertices': [[10, 10, 10], [11, 9, 8]],
    'faces': [[0, 1, 4]]
}
print(cleanup_mesh(mesh_data))  # Output: {0: [0, 1, 2, 3]}

    """Here is the Google-style docstring for the given function:

```python
def cleanup_mesh():
    """
    Deletes and manipulates a 3D mesh object.

    Selects all cube objects in the scene, joins them into a single object,
    toggles edit mode, saves the mesh data to a variable, removes overlapping
    vertices, de-selects all faces, selects only "floor" and "ceiling" faces,
    and finally deletes any remaining faces leaving behind an empty hollow mesh.
