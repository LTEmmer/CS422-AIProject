# generate_level

    Purpose

    This Python function generates a simple level by clearing a scene, initializing a 2D map matrix, building out the map using two functions, populating the scene with cubes according to the map matrix, and removing interior faces from the mesh.

The purpose of this code is to create a starting point for a 2D game or simulation level.
    Parameters

    ```python
def generate_level(size: int) -> None:
    """
    Generates a simple level by clearing a scene, initializing a 2D map matrix,
    building out the map using two functions, populating the scene with cubes according to the map matrix,
    and removing interior faces from the mesh.

    Parameters:
    size (int): The size of the level in units. This value determines both the dimensions of the map and the number of visible cubes.
    
    Usage Constraints:
    - The size parameter must be a positive integer.
    - The generated level will always have at least one cube, regardless of the size.

```python
def clear_scene() -> None:
