# build_wall

    Purpose

    This function is used to build a wall in a 2D level map based on user-specified constraints, such as the type of wall (vertical or horizontal) and specific hole coordinates. 

- It first calculates the position and value of each point in the wall by generating a random number between specified minimum and maximum values.
- Then it updates the corresponding points in the level map according to whether the generated numbers are considered for being on the top, middle, or bottom side of the wall. 
- The function does not handle cases where the calculated point is out of range or falls outside of the specified hole coordinates.
    Parameters

    ```python
def build_wall(level_map: dict, is_vertical: bool, minimum: int, maximum: int, loc: tuple) -> None:
    """
    Builds a wall in a 2D level map based on user-specified constraints.

    This function calculates the position and value of each point in the wall by generating a random number between specified
    minimum and maximum values. It then updates the corresponding points in the level map according to whether the generated numbers
    are considered for being on the top, middle, or bottom side of the wall.

    Parameters:
    level_map (dict): The 2D level map containing points with their respective coordinates.
    is_vertical (bool): A boolean indicating whether the wall should be vertical (True) or horizontal (False).
    minimum (int): The minimum value for generating random numbers.
    maximum (int): The maximum value for generating random numbers.
    loc (tuple): The coordinates of a point to update in the level map.

    Returns:
    None

def build_wall(max_val, min_val):
    """
    Builds a wall in a 2D level map based on user-specified constraints.

    Args:
        max_val (int): The maximum value to be used for generating point values.
        min_val (int): The minimum value to be used for generating point values.

    Returns:
        list: A list of tuples representing the position and value of each point in the wall. If a generated number falls outside or out of range, it is considered invalid.

    Description:
        This function first calculates the position and value of each point in the wall by generating random numbers between min_val and max_val.
        It then updates the corresponding points in the level map according to whether the generated numbers are considered for being on top, middle, or bottom side of the wall.

    Special cases:
        - If a generated number is outside of the specified hole coordinates (top or bottom), it will not be updated in the level map.
        - If the calculated point is out of range or falls outside of the specified hole coordinates (top or bottom), it will not be considered for being on top, middle, or bottom side of the wall.

    Examples:
        >>> build_wall(100, 50)
        [(25, 25, 'wall'), (30, 35, 'wall')]
        >>> build_wall(10, 20)
        [(15, 5, 'wall'), (18, 8, 'wall')]
