# add_cubes

    Purpose

    The purpose of this function is to place cubes in a level map based on the values present in the map.

```python
def add_cubes(level_map):
    # Initialize variables for iterating over the level map
    y = 0
    for row in level_map:
        x = 0
        # Iterate over each value in the current row
        for value in row:
            # Check if the cell has a value of 0 (indicating it should be a cube)
            if value == 0:  
                # Place a primitive cube add operation to create a new cube
                bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=2, enter_editmode=False, location=(x, y, 0))
        # Move down to the next row by incrementing both x and y variables
        y += 2
    ```
    Parameters

    ```python
def add_cubes(level_map):
    """
    The purpose of this function is to place cubes in a level map based on the values present in the map.

    Parameters
    ----------
    level_map : list[list[int]]
        A 2D list representing the level map, where values present in the map indicate cell locations.
        Values are integers (0 for empty cells and non-zero values indicating cube locations).

    Returns
    -------
    None
        The function modifies the input `level_map` by placing cubes as specified.

    Constraints
    ----------
    The input `level_map` is expected to be a valid 2D list of integers.
    Any cell location (i.e., value) that is not an integer between -1 and 100 will result in an error.
    """
```
    Returns

    ```python
def add_cubes(level_map):
    """
    Place cubes in a level map based on the values present in the map.

    The function iterates over each cell in the level map, and for cells with value 0,
    it places a primitive cube add operation to create a new cube at the specified location.

    Returns:
        list: An empty list as the return value

    Description:
        This function is designed to create a level map by placing cubes (primitive
        3D objects) on top of each other based on the values present in the input map.

    Special cases:
        None
```
    Examples

    ```python
def add_cubes(cubes1, cubes2):
    """
    Adds two lists of cubes.

    Args:
        cubes1 (list): The first list of cubes.
        cubes2 (list): The second list of cubes.

    Returns:
        list: A new list containing all elements from the input lists concatenated together.

    Examples:
    ```python
    # Basic usage
    cubes1 = [1, 2, 3]
    cubes2 = [4, 5, 6]
    result = add_cubes(cubes1, cubes2)
    print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

    # Edge case
    cubes1 = []
    cubes2 = [1, 2, 3]
    try:
        result = add_cubes(cubes1, cubes2)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)  # Output: valueError: list must contain elements of the same type

    # Advanced scenario
    cubes1 = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    cubes2 = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]
    result = add_cubes(cubes1, cubes2)
    print(result)  # Output: [[1, 2, 5, 6], [3, 4, 7, 8]]
