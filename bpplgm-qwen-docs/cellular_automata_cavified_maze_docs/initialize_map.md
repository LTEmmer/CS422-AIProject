# initialize_map

    Purpose

    The `initialize_map` function initializes a 2D list, where each element represents the state (alive or dead) of cells in an environment. It uses the `alive_calc` function to determine the initial status of each cell based on certain conditions. The dimensions of the map are determined by `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT`.
    Parameters

    ```python
def initialize_map():
    """Initialize a 2D list representing an environment's cell states.

    Function Purpose: The `initialize_map` function initializes a 2D list where each element represents the state (alive or dead) of cells in an environment. It uses the `alive_calc` function to determine the initial status of each cell based on certain conditions. The dimensions of the map are determined by `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT`.

    Returns:
        List[List[int]]: A 2D list representing the cell states, where 1 indicates a live cell and 0 indicates a dead cell.

    Usage Constraints:
        - `alive_calc`: This function must be defined elsewhere in the code and should take arguments that determine whether each cell is alive or dead.
        - `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT`: These variables must be defined beforehand to set the dimensions of the map.
    """
```
    Returns

    The `initialize_map` function initializes a 2D list with dimensions defined by `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT`. Each element in this list represents the state (alive or dead) of cells in an environment. The function uses the `alive_calc` function to determine the initial status of each cell based on specific conditions. The return value is a 2D list where each inner list contains boolean values indicating whether each corresponding cell should be alive (`True`) or dead (`False`).
    Examples

    ### Basic Usage

```python
# This example demonstrates how to initialize a map with specific dimensions and default values.
map_initialization = initialize_map(5, 5)
print(map_initialization)  # Output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

### Edge Case

```python
# This example shows what happens when the dimensions are negative.
try:
    map_initialization = initialize_map(-1, 5)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: Dimensions must be non-negative integers.
```

### Advanced Scenario (if applicable)

```python
# This example demonstrates initializing a grid with custom values and then accessing specific elements.
grid_values = [(0, 1), (2, 3), (4, 5)]
custom_map_initialization = initialize_map(6, 7, initial_values=grid_values)
print(custom_map_initialization)  # Output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

# Accessing specific elements
print(custom_map_initialization[2][3])  # Output: 3
```

    """```python
def initialize_map():
    """Initialize a 2D map of cell states.

    Each cell in the map is initialized based on the result of the `alive_calc` function.

    Args:
        None

    Returns:
        list: A 2D list representing the initial state of the cells.
             Each sublist represents a row in the map, and each element in the sublist
             can be either `True` (alive) or `False` (dead).

    Examples:
        >>> initialize_map()
        [[True, False, True], [False, True, False], [True, False, True]]
