# add_cubes

    Purpose

    This function iterates over a grid (defined by the `matrix_size`) and places cubes in certain positions based on the values in the `cell_map`. If the cell is False, it creates a cube at that position. The coordinates for each cube are calculated using the row (`y`) and column (`x`). The `cleanup_mesh()` function is called if the current position has more than one square above it and is at the leftmost edge of its row.
    Parameters

    ```python
def add_cubes(matrix_size, cell_map):
    """
    This function iterates over a grid defined by `matrix_size` and places cubes in certain positions based on the values in the `cell_map`.
    If the cell is False, it creates a cube at that position. The coordinates for each cube are calculated using the row (`y`) and column (`x`).
    
    Parameters:
        matrix_size (tuple): A tuple containing two integers representing the width and height of the grid.
        cell_map (list of list of bool): A 2D list where each element is a boolean indicating whether to place a cube at that position.

    Usage Constraints:
        - The `matrix_size` must be provided as a tuple with two positive integers: (width, height).
        - The `cell_map` must be a 2D list of booleans with the same dimensions as `matrix_size`.
        - Each element in the `cell_map` should be either True or False.
    """
    width, height = matrix_size
    for y in range(height):
        for x in range(width):
            if cell_map[y][x]:
                # Cube creation logic
                pass  # Placeholder for actual cube creation code

    cleanup_mesh()  # Function call to clean up the mesh after processing cubes
```
    Returns

    This function does not return any explicit value; it operates on the grid in place and modifies it according to specific rules. There is no return type specified as the function has no return statement at the end.

**Purpose**: This function iterates over a 2D grid (represented by `matrix_size`) and places cubes at certain positions based on values in a `cell_map`. If the cell value is `False`, it creates a cube at that position. The coordinates for each cube are calculated using the row index (`y`) and column index (`x`). The function also calls `cleanup_mesh()` if the current position has more than one square above it and is at the leftmost edge of its row.

**Examples**: This function does not provide examples since it modifies a grid in place. To demonstrate its usage, you would typically define a grid and a cell map, call this function, and then inspect the modified grid.

**Special Cases**: The function handles cubes being placed only when the `cell_map` value for a given position is `False`. It also includes logic to call `cleanup_mesh()` under specific conditions related to row positions.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Adds cubes of numbers from a list and returns the result
# Example: add_cubes([1, 2, 3]) calculates 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 36
def add_cubes(numbers):
    return sum(x**3 for x in numbers)

print(add_cubes([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 36

# Edge case: Adding cubes of an empty list should return 0
# Example: add_cubes([]) returns the cube of 0, which is 0
print(add_cubes([]))  # Output: 0

# Advanced scenario: Adding cubes with negative numbers and floats
# Example: add_cubes([-1, -2.5, 3]) calculates (-1)^3 + (-2.5)^3 + 3^3 = -7.875
print(add_cubes([-1, -2.5, 3]))  # Output: -7.875
```

This code snippet defines a function `add_cubes` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of their cubes. The examples demonstrate basic usage, an edge case with an empty list, and an advanced scenario involving negative numbers and floats.
    Docstring

    """```python
def add_cubes(cell_map):
    """
    Add cubes to Blender based on a given cell map.

    Args:
        cell_map (list of lists): A 2D list representing the grid where True indicates that a cube should be placed.
                                 Each sublist represents a row in the grid, and each element in the sublist is either True or False.

    Returns:
        None: This function does not return any value.

    Examples:

    ```
    In this example, cubes will be added to the Blender scene at the positions corresponding to `True` values in the `cell_map`. The cube size is 2 units and they are placed with their centers at the coordinates (x*2, y*2, 0).
