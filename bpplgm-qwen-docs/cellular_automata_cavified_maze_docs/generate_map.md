# generate_map

    Purpose

    This function generates and simulates a cellular automaton known as Conway's Game of Life. It initializes a random map, then iterates the game simulation for a specified number of steps, updating the state of each cell based on its neighbors' states according to the rules of the Game of Life.
    Parameters

    ```python
def generate_map(height=20, width=20, generations=100):
    """
    Generate and simulate a cellular automaton known as Conway's Game of Life.

    Args:
        height (int): The height of the map. Default is 20.
        width (int): The width of the map. Default is 20.
        generations (int): The number of simulation steps to run. Default is 100.

    Returns:
        list: A 2D list representing the final state of the map after the specified number of generations.

    Usage Constraints:
        - height and width must be positive integers.
        - generations must be a non-negative integer.

    # Example usage:
    # result = generate_map(height=50, width=50, generations=200)

    Returns

    ### Function: `generate_map`

**Purpose:** This function generates and simulates a cellular automaton known as Conway's Game of Life. It initializes a random map and iterates the game simulation for a specified number of steps, updating the state of each cell based on its neighbors' states according to the rules of the Game of Life.

**Parameters:**
- `width` (int): The width of the grid.
- `height` (int): The height of the grid.
- `num_steps` (int): The number of steps to simulate.

**Return Value:**
- **Type:** `List[List[int]]`
- **Description:** A 2D list representing the final state of the grid after the simulation has completed. Each cell is represented by an integer value where `1` indicates a live cell and `0` indicates a dead cell.
- **Special Cases:**
  - If the input parameters are invalid (e.g., negative values for `width`, `height`, or `num_steps`), the function will raise a `ValueError`.
  - If `num_steps` is zero, the function will return an empty grid.

**Examples:**

```python
# Example usage
result = generate_map(10, 10, 5)
for row in result:
    print(row)

# Output for a randomly generated map after 5 steps
# The output will vary each time due to random initialization.
```

This function is designed to simulate the classic Game of Life rules where dead cells with exactly three live neighbors become alive, and live cells with two or three live neighbors remain alive. All other cells die or stay dead.
    Examples

    ```python
# Explanation: This function generates a map based on the provided data. It takes in geographical coordinates and corresponding population data to create a visual representation.

def generate_map(data):
    # Code for generating a map

# Example 1: Basic usage
data = {
    'coordinates': [(40.7128, -74.0060), (34.0522, -118.2437)],
    'population': [10000, 20000]
}
generate_map(data)

# Explanation: This example demonstrates how to call the generate_map function with a simple dataset containing geographical coordinates and population data. The map should display these points with corresponding populations.

# Example 2: Edge case
data = {
    'coordinates': [(40.7128, -74.0060)],
    'population': [0]
}
generate_map(data)

# Explanation: This example showcases how to handle an edge case where the population data for a single point is zero. The function should still create a map but display it correctly even if there are no populated areas.

# Example 3: Advanced scenario
data = {
    'coordinates': [(40.7128, -74.0060), (34.0522, -118.2437)],
    'population': [10000, 20000],
    'additional_info': ['New York', 'Los Angeles']
}
generate_map(data)

# Explanation: This example demonstrates how to use additional information (e.g., city names) in the map generation. The function should be able to handle and display these details on the map if they are provided.
