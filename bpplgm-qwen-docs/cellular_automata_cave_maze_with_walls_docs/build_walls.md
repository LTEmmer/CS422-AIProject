# build_walls

    Purpose

    The `build_walls` function iterates over a list of positions that have been visited and checks each neighbor's availability to place a wall. If a neighbor is available, the wall is placed at that position. This process continues for all visited positions in the list.
    Parameters

    The `build_walls` function is designed to process a list of positions where walls have been visited. The function iterates over each position in this list and checks if there are any available neighbors for placing a wall.

Here's the detailed documentation:

```python
def build_walls(visited_positions):
    """
    Build walls at the given locations.

    Args:
        visited_positions (List[Tuple[int, int]]): A list of tuples representing visited positions on a 2D grid. Each tuple contains two integers representing the x and y coordinates of the position.

    Returns:
        None

    Notes:
        - The function will attempt to place walls at each visited position.
        - If a neighbor is available (i.e., not already occupied), a wall is placed at that position.
        - This process continues for all visited positions in the list.

    Examples:
        >>> build_walls([(0, 0), (1, 2)])
        # No example code provided as this function does not return any output
    """
```

**Usage Constraints:**
- The `visited_positions` parameter must be a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the x and y coordinates.
- These coordinates should correspond to valid positions on a 2D grid.
    Returns

    ```python
def build_walls(visited_positions):
    """
    Place walls at positions marked as visited.

    Args:
        visited_positions (list): A list of positions that have been visited and need walls to be placed.

    Returns:
        None: The function modifies the grid in-place by placing walls at each position in visited_positions.
        
    Special Cases:
        - If `visited_positions` is an empty list, no walls are placed.

    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Build a simple fence with 4 posts and 6 sections
build_walls(4, 6)

# Explanation:
# This function builds a wall using 4 posts and 6 sections. Each section is one inch thick.
# The function will draw the walls according to these specifications.

# Edge case: Try to build a wall with negative dimensions
try:
    build_walls(-1, 5)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Explanation:
    # This error occurs because the function expects non-negative integers for both posts and sections.
    # If it receives negative values, it will raise a ValueError.

# Advanced scenario: Build a wall with adjustable height and material
build_walls(4, 6, thickness=2, material='concrete')  # Explanation:
# This advanced usage demonstrates how to customize the wall's properties. It sets the wall's thickness to 2 inches
# and specifies that it should be made of concrete. The function will draw the wall with these customizations.
```
