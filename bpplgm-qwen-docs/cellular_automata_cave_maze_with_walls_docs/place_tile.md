# place_tile

    Purpose

    The function `place_tile` creates a plane mesh in Blender at the specified coordinates `(x, y)` with a size of 2 units and places it at `-1` units along the Z-axis. This is useful for adding surfaces to a Blender scene.
    Parameters

    ```python
def place_tile(x: float, y: float) -> None:
    """
    Creates a plane mesh in Blender at the specified coordinates (x, y) with a size of 2 units
    and places it at -1 unit along the Z-axis.

    Args:
        x (float): The X-coordinate where the tile should be placed.
        y (float): The Y-coordinate where the tile should be placed.

    Returns:
        None

    Usage Constraints:
        - `x` and `y` must be numerical values representing the coordinates in Blender space.
        - The function will create a mesh object that can be used as a surface element in a Blender scene.
        - The Z-axis position of the tile is fixed at `-1` to ensure proper stacking.

    Examples:
        >>> place_tile(0, 0)
        # Creates a plane mesh at (0, 0) with size 2 units and places it at -1 along the Z-axis

        >>> place_tile(-5, 5)
        # Creates a plane mesh at (-5, 5) with size 2 units and places it at -1 along the Z-axis
    """
```
    Returns

    ```python
def place_tile(x: float, y: float) -> None:
    """
    Create a plane mesh in Blender at the specified coordinates (x, y) with a size of 2 units and places it at -1 unit along the Z-axis.
    
    This function creates a new plane object and sets its properties as follows:
    - Position: (x, y, -1)
    - Size: 2 units by 2 units
    
    Args:
        x (float): The x-coordinate for the center of the tile.
        y (float): The y-coordinate for the center of the tile.
    
    Returns:
        None
        
    Examples:
        place_tile(0.5, 0.5)
        # This will create a plane mesh centered at (0.5, 0.5) with size 2 units along both axes and placed at -1 unit along the Z-axis.
    """
```
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage
# Place a tile at the current cursor position in the game board
def place_tile(self):
    # Find the current position of the cursor in the game board
    current_position = self.game_board.cursor_position
    # Place the tile on the game board
    self.game_board.place_tile(current_position)

# Edge case
# Attempt to place a tile at an invalid position, e.g., out of bounds
def place_invalid_tile(self):
    # Move the cursor off the game board
    self.game_board.move_cursor_out_of_bounds()
    # Place a tile at the new cursor position (which is now invalid)
    self.place_tile()

# Advanced scenario
# Place multiple tiles on the game board in a specific sequence
def place_multiple_tiles_sequence(self):
    # Define a sequence of positions for placing tiles
    positions = [(0, 0), (1, 2), (3, 4)]
    # Iterate over the sequence and place each tile at the corresponding position
    for pos in positions:
        self.game_board.move_cursor_to(pos)
        self.place_tile()
```
