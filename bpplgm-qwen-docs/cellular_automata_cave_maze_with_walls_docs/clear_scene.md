# clear_scene

    Purpose

    The function `clear_scene` clears the current Blender scene by switching to object mode, selecting all objects, and then deleting them.
    Parameters

    ```python
def clear_scene():
    """
    Clears the current Blender scene by switching to object mode, selecting all objects, and then deleting them.

    Parameters:
        None

    Returns:
        None
    """

    # Switch to Object Mode
    bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = None  # Ensure no active object
    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')

    # Select All Objects
    bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')

    # Delete Selected Objects
    bpy.ops.object.delete(use_global=False)
```
    Returns

    ```python
def clear_scene():
    """
    Clears the current Blender scene by switching to object mode, selecting all objects,
    and then deleting them.

    Returns:
        None

    Special Cases:
        - If there are no objects in the scene, this function will do nothing.
        - The function will not affect any UI elements or other non-object data within the scene.
        - It does not remove any external assets or configurations that may be present
          outside of Blender's current session.

    Examples:
        clear_scene()
    """
```
    Examples

    # Basic usage
