# add_tiles

    Purpose

    This function `add_tiles` iterates through each cell of a 2D `cell_map`. If the cell is marked as False, it places a tile at coordinates that are twice the original cell's coordinates and appends the new tile's position to a list called `visited`.

**Examples:**

Since no specific `cell_map` or `place_tile` function is provided in your code snippet, there aren't any examples to demonstrate how this function would be used.
    Parameters

    ```python
def add_tiles(cell_map):
    """
    This function iterates through each cell in a 2D `cell_map`. If the cell is marked as False,
    it places a tile at coordinates that are twice the original cell's coordinates and appends the new tile's position to a list called `visited`.

    Parameters:
        cell_map (list of lists): A 2D grid representing cells, where each element can be True or False.
                                  If an element is False, a tile will be placed at its coordinates multiplied by 2.

    Returns:
        None

    Example usage:
    >>> add_tiles([[False, True], [True, False]])
    # No output, but `visited` list would contain the positions of tiles if placed
    """
```
    Returns

    The `add_tiles` function returns a list called `visited`, which contains the coordinates of all tiles added to the game board. Each tile is placed at coordinates that are twice the original cell's coordinates, and the function iterates through each cell in the `cell_map`. If a cell is marked as False (indicating it should have a tile), its doubled coordinates are appended to the `visited` list.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Adding two tiles in a grid layout
# This demonstrates how to add two tiles to a container using a grid layout.

import tkinter as tk

root = tk.Tk()
container = tk.Frame(root)
container.pack(fill='both', expand=True)

tile1 = tk.Label(container, text="Tile 1", bg="blue")
tile2 = tk.Label(container, text="Tile 2", bg="red")

# Using grid layout to add tiles
tile1.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=5, pady=5)
tile2.grid(row=0, column=1, padx=5, pady=5)

root.mainloop()
```

```python
# Edge case: Adding a tile without specifying row and column
# This scenario demonstrates how to add a single tile directly to the container without specifying its position.

import tkinter as tk

root = tk.Tk()
container = tk.Frame(root)
container.pack(fill='both', expand=True)

tile = tk.Label(container, text="Tile")

# Adding a tile directly to the container without specifying row and column
tile.grid()

root.mainloop()
```

```python
# Advanced scenario: Dynamically adding tiles based on user input or data
# This example demonstrates how to add tiles to a container in response to user input or data.

import tkinter as tk

def add_tiles(data):
    container = tk.Frame(root)
    container.pack(fill='both', expand=True)

    for item in data:
        tile = tk.Label(container, text=item)
        tile.grid(row=data.index(item), column=0, padx=5, pady=5)

root = tk.Tk()

# Example usage: Adding tiles based on user input
input_data = ["Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"]
add_tiles(input_data)

root.mainloop()
```

    """```python
def add_tiles(cell_map):
    """
    Adds cubes to the cell map based on the positions where cells are False.

    Args:
        cell_map (list): A 2D list representing the grid with True or False values,
                         indicating whether a tile should be placed at that position.

        None
