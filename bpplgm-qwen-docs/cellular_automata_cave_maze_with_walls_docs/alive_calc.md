# alive_calc

    Purpose

    The function `alive_calc` randomly determines whether an entity should start in an "alive" state based on a given probability (`CHANCE_TO_START_ALIVE`). If the random number is less than this chance, it returns `True`, indicating that the entity starts alive. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
    Parameters

    ```python
def alive_calc():
    """Randomly determines if an entity starts in an "alive" state based on a given probability.

    Args:
        None.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the entity starts alive, False otherwise.
    """
```

The `alive_calc` function does not take any parameters. It generates a random number and checks if it is less than the specified `CHANCE_TO_START_ALIVE`. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that the entity should start in an "alive" state; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Examples:
```python
print(alive_calc())  # This could print True or False based on the random number generated
```
    Returns

    ```python
def alive_calc():
    """Determines whether an entity should start in an "alive" state based on a given probability.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the entity starts alive, False otherwise. This is determined by comparing
              a random number generated with `CHANCE_TO_START_ALIVE`. If the random number is less
              than `CHANCE_TO_START_ALIVE`, the function returns True, indicating the entity starts alive.
              Otherwise, it returns False.

    Special Cases:
        - If `CHANCE_TO_START_ALIVE` is set to 0.0, `alive_calc` will always return False.
          This means no entity will start alive.
        - If `CHANCE_TO_START_ALIVE` is set to 1.0, `alive_calc` will always return True.
          This means all entities will start alive.

    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Calculates the age in days from a given birthdate.
from datetime import date

def alive_calc(birth_date):
    today = date.today()
    return (today - birth_date).days

birthdate_1 = date(1985, 5, 10)
print(alive_calc(birthdate_1))  # Output: The number of days since May 10, 1985
```

```python
# Edge case: Birthdate is today.
from datetime import date

def alive_calc(birth_date):
    today = date.today()
    return (today - birth_date).days

birthdate_2 = date(2023, 1, 1)
print(alive_calc(birthdate_2))  # Output: 0, since today is January 1, 2023
```

```python
# Advanced scenario: Calculates the age in years from a given birthdate.
from datetime import date

def alive_calc(birth_date):
    today = date.today()
    return (today - birth_date).days // 365

birthdate_3 = date(1980, 2, 29)
print(alive_calc(birthdate_3))  # Output: The number of years since February 29, 1980
```
