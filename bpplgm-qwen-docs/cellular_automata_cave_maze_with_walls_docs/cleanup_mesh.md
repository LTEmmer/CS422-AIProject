# cleanup_mesh

    Purpose

    The function `cleanup_mesh` is designed to join multiple selected 3D objects into one mesh and then clean it up by removing duplicate vertices. This can be useful for ensuring that the final output has no overlapping vertices, which can improve rendering quality or make further editing easier.
    Parameters

    ```python
def cleanup_mesh():
    """
    Join multiple selected 3D objects into one mesh and clean it up by removing duplicate vertices.

    This function is designed to consolidate multiple separate meshes into a single, seamless mesh by joining them together.
    It then processes the resulting mesh to remove any duplicate vertices that might exist due to overlapping geometry or extraneous data.

    :return: The cleaned-up mesh object after merging and deduplicating vertices.
    """
```

**Examples:**

```python
import bpy

# Assuming multiple objects are selected in the scene
cleanup_mesh()
```

In this example, `cleanup_mesh()` is called without any arguments to merge all the currently selected 3D objects into a single mesh. After the function executes, the resulting mesh will have duplicate vertices removed, ensuring that it is free from overlaps and can be used for further processing or rendering tasks without issues.
    Returns

    **Function Name:** `cleanup_mesh`

**Purpose:**

The function `cleanup_mesh` is designed to join multiple selected 3D objects into one mesh and then clean it up by removing duplicate vertices. This can be useful for ensuring that the final output has no overlapping vertices, which can improve rendering quality or make further editing easier.

**Return Value:**

- **Return Type:** `Mesh`
- **Description:** The function returns a new `Mesh` object containing the cleaned-up mesh. If the input is already a single mesh or an empty list, it simply returns the original input.
- **Special Cases:**
  - If the input list contains only one object, the function will return that object without any changes.
  - If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list.

**Examples:**

```python
import bpy

# Assuming 'mesh_object' and 'object_to_join' are Blender mesh objects
cleaned_mesh = cleanup_mesh([mesh_object, object_to_join])
bpy.context.collection.objects.link(cleaned_mesh)
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `cleanup_mesh` function to join two mesh objects into one, then link the resulting cleaned mesh back into the scene.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Cleans up a mesh by removing unused vertices and faces.
cleanup_mesh(mesh_obj)

# Edge case: Attempt to clean up a mesh that is already in its optimal state.
cleanup_mesh(mesh_already_clean)
```

```python
# Advanced scenario: Cleans up a complex mesh with multiple materials and UVs.
cleanup_mesh(multi_material_mesh)
```

```python
# Explanation of how the cleanup function works:
# It takes a mesh object as input, which could be an instance of a 3D model or graphics library class representing a mesh.
# The cleanup function processes the mesh to remove any vertices and faces that are not connected to any other vertices,
# effectively simplifying the mesh and reducing its complexity. This is particularly useful for optimization purposes
# in rendering applications where performance and memory usage are critical.
```

    """```python
def cleanup_mesh():
    """
    Cleans up a mesh by joining selected objects into one, entering edit mode,
    selecting all vertices, removing doubles to clean up overlapping verts, and exiting edit mode.

    Args:
        None

    Returns:
        None

    Examples:
        >>> import bpy
        >>> cleanup_mesh()
        # This function will select all cubes in the scene, join them into one object,
        # enter edit mode, remove any double vertices, and then exit edit mode.
