# check_neighbors_and_place_wall

    Purpose

    The function `check_neighbors_and_place_wall` takes a position as input and checks the positions immediately above, below, left, and right of it. If these positions are not already visited or part of the walls list, it places a cube at those positions and adds them to the walls list.
    Parameters

    ```python
def check_neighbors_and_place_wall(pos):
    """
    Checks the positions immediately above, below, left, and right of the given position.

    Parameters:
        pos (list): The current position as a list [x, y, z] representing coordinates in 3D space.

    Returns:
        None: This function modifies the walls list in place.
    """

# Example usage
walls = []
check_neighbors_and_place_wall([1, 2, 3])
print(walls)  # Output will depend on the implementation details of check_neighbors_and_place_wall
```
    Returns

    The `check_neighbors_and_place_wall` function does not return a value; it modifies the game state by placing cubes at adjacent positions and adding them to the walls list. Here is a detailed explanation:

### Function Purpose:
- The function takes a position as input.
- It checks the positions immediately above, below, left, and right of the given position.
- If any of these positions are not already visited or part of the `walls` list, it places a cube at those positions and adds them to the `walls` list.

### Return Value:
- **Return Type**: `None`
- **Description**: The function does not return any value; it modifies the game state in place.
- **Special Cases**:
  - If no valid adjacent positions exist (i.e., all four neighboring positions are either visited or part of the walls list), the function does nothing and returns early, ensuring that unnecessary modifications to the game state are avoided.

### Examples Using the Existing Code:

```python
# Example usage in a hypothetical game context

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.walls = []  # List to store wall positions
        self.visited = set()  # Set to track visited positions

    def check_neighbors_and_place_wall(self, position):
        if position not in self.visited:
            self.visited.add(position)
            for neighbor in [(position[0], position[1] + 1), (position[0], position[1] - 1), 
                            (position[0] + 1, position[1]), (position[0] - 1, position[1])]:
                if neighbor not in self.walls and neighbor not in self.visited:
                    self.walls.append(neighbor)
                    print(f"Placed wall at {neighbor}")

# Usage
game = Game()
game.check_neighbors_and_place_wall((3, 4))
```

In this example, the function `check_neighbors_and_place_wall` is called with the position `(3, 4)`. If the position `(3, 5)` (above), `(3, 3)` (below), `(4, 4)` (left), or `(2, 4)` (right) are not already visited or part of the `walls` list, a cube is placed at those positions and added to the `walls` list.
