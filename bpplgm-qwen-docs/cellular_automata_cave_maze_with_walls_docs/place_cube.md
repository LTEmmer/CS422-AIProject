# place_cube

    Purpose

    The function `place_cube` uses Blender's API to create a cube at the specified coordinates `(x, y)` with a size of 2 units. It places the cube in edit mode and sets its location accordingly.
    Parameters

    ```python
def place_cube(x: float, y: float) -> None:
    """
    Place a cube at the specified coordinates (x, y).

    Args:
        x (float): The x-coordinate where the cube should be placed.
        y (float): The y-coordinate where the cube should be placed.

    Returns:
        None

    Usage Constraints:
        - Ensure Blender is running and accessible within the environment where this function is called.
        - The coordinates provided should be valid numbers representing the position on the Blender scene's grid.
        - This function will create a cube in edit mode at the specified coordinates, so it may interfere with other operations if executed during runtime.
    """
```

**Examples:**

```python
# Example 1:
place_cube(0.5, 2.3)

# Example 2:
place_cube(-1.2, -0.8)
```

Please note that the `place_cube` function is designed to work with Blender's API and assumes that Blender is already running in a compatible environment. The coordinates should be valid numbers representing positions on the Blender scene's grid, and executing this function during runtime may interfere with other operations.
    Returns

    The `place_cube` function does not return any value. It uses Blender's API to create a cube at the specified coordinates `(x, y)` with a size of 2 units and places it in edit mode, setting its location accordingly. Special cases include handling errors during the creation or placement process, which are typically managed through exception handling within the function.
    Examples

    ```python
# Explanation: This function places a cube at a specified position in 3D space. It takes three parameters:
# - position: A tuple (x, y, z) representing the coordinates where the cube should be placed.
# - color: A string representing the color of the cube.
# - size: An integer representing the side length of the cube.

# Basic usage
place_cube((10, 20, 30), 'red', 5)

# Explanation: This example places a red cube with a side length of 5 at the position (10, 20, 30) in 3D space.
```

```python
# Explanation: This function is designed to handle edge cases where the color might not be recognized. It includes error handling for invalid colors and ensures that the size is within a reasonable range.

# Edge case
try:
    place_cube((10, 20, 30), 'yellow', -5)  # Invalid size
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)

# Explanation: This example demonstrates how to handle an error when trying to place a cube with an invalid color and ensures that the size is within a valid range.
```

```python
# Explanation: This advanced scenario showcases how to apply multiple transformations before placing the cube. It rotates the cube by 45 degrees around its y-axis before positioning it.

# Advanced scenario
place_cube((10, 20, 30), 'blue', 8)
rotate(45, 'y')  # Apply a rotation transformation
place_cube((10, 20, 30), 'blue', 8)  # Position the cube again after rotation

# Explanation: This example demonstrates how to apply a rotation transformation before placing a cube and ensures that both transformations are applied correctly.

    """```python
def place_cube(x, y):

    Places a cube at specified (x, y) coordinates in 3D space.

    Args:

    Returns:
