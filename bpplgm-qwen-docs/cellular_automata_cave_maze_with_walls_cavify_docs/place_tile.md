# place_tile

    Purpose

    The `place_tile` function uses Blender's Python API to create a plane (or tile) at the specified coordinates `(x, y)` in 3D space.
    Parameters

    ```python
def place_tile(x: float, y: float):
    """
    The `place_tile` function creates a plane (or tile) at the specified coordinates `(x, y)` in 3D space.

    Parameters:
    x (float): The X coordinate where the tile should be placed.
    y (float): The Y coordinate where the tile should be placed.

    Usage Constraints:
    - Both `x` and `y` must be numerical values representing floating-point coordinates in Blender's scene.
    - This function is part of a larger system for creating a floor or ground plane with tiles, and it uses Blender's Python API to manipulate the 3D space.
    """
```

### Examples:
```python
# Example usage of place_tile to create a tile at coordinates (10.5, 15.2)
place_tile(10.5, 15.2)
```
    Returns

    ```python
def place_tile(x, y):
    """
    Creates a plane (or tile) at the specified coordinates (x, y) in 3D space.

    Returns:
        None

    Special Cases:
        - If 'x' or 'y' is negative, it may lead to unexpected behavior due to Blender's coordinate system.
        - If the plane cannot be created for any other reason, the function will raise an error.
    """
```

In summary, `place_tile` does not return anything.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: place a tile in a specified position on a grid.
def place_tile(grid, row, col, tile):
    """
    Place a given tile at the specified (row, col) position on the grid.

    Parameters:
    - grid (list of lists): The current state of the game board.
    - row (int): The row index where the tile should be placed.
    - col (int): The column index where the tile should be placed.
    - tile: The tile to place, which could be a string representing the tile's symbol.

    Returns:
    - grid (list of lists): The updated game board after placing the tile.
    """
    # Example usage
    board = [[" ", "X", "O"], ["O", "X", " "], [" ", " ", " "]]
    new_board = place_tile(board, 1, 2, "X")
    print(new_board)
    # Output: [[' ', 'X', 'O'], ['O', 'X', 'X'], [' ', ' ', ' ']]

# Edge case: Trying to place a tile outside the grid boundaries.
def place_tile_outside_bounds(grid, row, col, tile):
    """
    Attempt to place a given tile at an out-of-bounds position on the grid.

    Parameters:
    - grid (list of lists): The current state of the game board.
    - row (int): The row index where the tile should be placed.
    - col (int): The column index where the tile should be placed.
    - tile: The tile to place, which could be a string representing the tile's symbol.

    Returns:
    - grid (list of lists): The original game board as no changes were made.
    """
    # Example usage
    board = [[" ", "X", "O"], ["O", "X", " "], [" ", " ", " "]]
    new_board = place_tile_outside_bounds(board, 3, 2, "X")
    print(new_board)
    # Output: [[' ', 'X', 'O'], ['O', 'X', ' '], [' ', ' ', ' ']]

# Advanced scenario: Place a tile in an occupied position and handle it gracefully.
def place_tile_occupied(grid, row, col, tile):
    """
    Attempt to place a given tile at a position where another tile is already present.

    Parameters:
    - grid (list of lists): The current state of the game board.
    - row (int): The row index where the tile should be placed.
    - col (int): The column index where the tile should be placed.
    - tile: The tile to place, which could be a string representing the tile's symbol.

    Returns:
    - grid (list of lists): The updated game board if successful; otherwise, the original board.

    print(new_board)
    # Output: [['X', 'O', 'X'], ['O', 'X', ' '], [' ', ' ', ' ']] (no change as the tile is already present)
