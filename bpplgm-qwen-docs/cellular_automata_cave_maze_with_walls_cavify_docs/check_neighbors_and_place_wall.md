# check_neighbors_and_place_wall

    Purpose

    The function `check_neighbors_and_place_wall` checks the neighboring positions of a given position `(pos[0], pos[1])`. If the neighbor has not been visited and is not already in the list of walls, it places a cube at that position and adds the position to the list of walls.
    Parameters

    ```python
def check_neighbors_and_place_wall(pos):
    """
    Checks the neighboring positions of a given position (pos[0], pos[1]).

    Parameters:
        - pos: A tuple representing the current position to be checked, with format (x, y).
          x and y are integers representing coordinates in a grid-like structure.

    Function purpose: The function `check_neighbors_and_place_wall` checks the neighboring positions of a given position `(pos[0], pos[1])`. If the neighbor has not been visited and is not already in the list of walls, it places a cube at that position and adds the position to the list of walls.

    Examples:
        # Given an initial grid setup with a starting point at (5, 3)
        walls = [(4, 2), (6, 1)]
        check_neighbors_and_place_wall((5, 3))

        # Assuming 'walls' now contains: [(4, 2), (6, 1), (5, 3)]

    Note:
        - The grid is assumed to be infinite in all directions.
        - The function does not handle out-of-bounds positions or changes to the grid structure.
        - The function assumes that 'walls' and 'pos' are defined and of the correct type as specified.

```
    Returns

    The `check_neighbors_and_place_wall` function does not explicitly return any value. It performs a series of checks and actions based on the given position, but it does not have a clear return statement that describes its outcome.

### Purpose
- The function checks the neighboring positions of a specified position `(pos[0], pos[1])`.
- If the neighbor has not been visited and is not already in the list of walls, it places a cube at that position and adds the position to the list of walls.
- It does not return any value after performing these actions.

### Special Cases
- If no valid neighbors are found or if all neighboring positions are either visited or already in the list of walls, the function does nothing.
- The function assumes that `pos` is a tuple containing two integers representing the x and y coordinates of the position to be checked.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Check and place a wall between two connected rooms if they are adjacent.
def check_neighbors_and_place_wall(room_list):
    # Example room list representing rooms with walls represented as '1'
    room_list = [[0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]

    # Check the left and right neighbors of the first room
    for neighbor in [room_list[0][0], room_list[0][-1]]:
        if neighbor == 0:
            # Place a wall between the current room and its neighbor
            room_list[0][0] = 1

# Edge case: Attempt to place a wall on an isolated room.
def check_neighbors_and_place_wall(room_list):
    # Example room list with no walls
    room_list = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]

    # Check the left neighbor of the first room
    for neighbor in [room_list[0][0]]:
        if neighbor == 0:
            # Attempt to place a wall, but there's no room on the left
            print("No available neighbor to place a wall.")

# Advanced scenario: Handle multiple walls between rooms.
def check_neighbors_and_place_wall(room_list):
    # Example room list with multiple gaps and walls represented as '1'
    room_list = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1]]

    # Check the top-left corner for gaps
    for neighbor in [room_list[0][0], room_list[0][1]]:
        if neighbor == 0:
            # Place a wall between the top and left rooms
            room_list[0][0] = 1

    # Check the bottom-right corner for gaps
    for neighbor in [room_list[-1][-1], room_list[-2][-1]]:
        if neighbor == 0:
            # Place a wall between the bottom and right rooms
            room_list[-1][-1] = 1
