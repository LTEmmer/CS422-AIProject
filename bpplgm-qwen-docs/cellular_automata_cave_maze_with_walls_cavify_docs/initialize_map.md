# initialize_map

    Purpose

    This function initializes a 2D grid representing a map, where each cell is initialized to the result of the `alive_calc()` function. The size of the grid is determined by the global variables `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT`. Each value in the grid is set to the output of `alive_calc()`, which appears to calculate or determine if a cell should be "alive" based on some conditions within the game of life.
    Parameters

    ```python
def initialize_map():
    """
    This function initializes a 2D grid representing a map where each cell is initialized to the result of the `alive_calc()` function.

    :param WIDTH: The width of the map.
    :type WIDTH: int

    :param HEIGHT: The height of the map.
    :type HEIGHT: int
    """
```
    Returns

    ```python
def initialize_map():
    """Initialize a 2D grid representing a map.

    This function initializes a 2D grid where each cell is set to the result of calling
    the `alive_calc()` function. The dimensions of the grid are determined by the
    global variables `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT`. Each value in the grid represents whether a
    cell should be considered "alive" based on the conditions defined within the game of life.

    Returns:
        list of lists of int: A 2D list where each sublist represents a row in the grid,
                            containing integers representing the state (alive or dead) of each cell.
                            The number of rows is `HEIGHT` and the number of columns is `WIDTH`.

    Special Cases:
        - If `alive_calc()` returns a value greater than 1, it should be treated as an error
          condition, indicating that the input values are not correctly processed in the game of life.
    """
    initial_map = [[alive_calc(x, y) for x in range(WIDTH)] for y in range(HEIGHT)]
    return initial_map
```

**Description**: The `initialize_map` function is designed to create a grid where each cell's state (alive or dead) is determined by the output of the `alive_calc()` function. The dimensions of this grid are specified by the global variables `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT`. Each value in the grid reflects whether a cell should be considered alive based on the rules of Conway's Game of Life. The function returns a 2D list where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with integers indicating the state of each cell.

**Special Cases**: If the `alive_calc()` function returns a value greater than 1, it is treated as an error condition, suggesting that there might be an issue with the input values or their processing within the game of life.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Initialize a map with default settings.
initialize_map()

# Edge case: Attempt to initialize a map with a custom size and color scheme.
initialize_map(size=500, color_scheme='dark')

# Advanced scenario: Initialize a map that will be used for multiple layers of data visualization.
initialize_map(layers=[('population', 'red'), ('climate', 'blue')], zoom_level=10)
```
    Docstring

    """```python
def initialize_map():
    """
    Initializes a game map with alive cells using a predefined `alive_calc` function and dimensions defined by WIDTH and HEIGHT.

    Returns:
        list: A 2D list representing the initial state of the game map, where each cell contains the result of `alive_calc()`.
    """
    return [[alive_calc() for i in range(WIDTH)] for j in range(HEIGHT)]

# Examples
initial_map = initialize_map()
print(initial_map)
```

This function initializes a game map by creating a 2D list. Each element in the list is determined by the `alive_calc` function, which is assumed to return an integer value representing the state of a cell (e.g., alive or dead). The dimensions of the map are specified by the global variables WIDTH and HEIGHT."""
