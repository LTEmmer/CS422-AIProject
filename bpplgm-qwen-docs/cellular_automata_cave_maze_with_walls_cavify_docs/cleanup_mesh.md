# cleanup_mesh

    Purpose

    This function, `cleanup_mesh`, combines and cleans up a collection of individual cube objects into a single mesh in Blender. It selects all cubes, joins them into one object, enters edit mode to remove doubles (duplicate vertices), and then exits edit mode to finalize the cleaning process.
    Parameters

    ```python
def cleanup_mesh():
    """
    Function purpose: This function, `cleanup_mesh`, combines and cleans up a collection of individual cube objects into a single mesh in Blender.

```python
# Usage Example:
# This is an example of how you might call the function 'cleanup_mesh'.
# It is assumed that there are multiple cube objects in your scene, and they will be combined into one object.

def cleanup_mesh():
    # Assuming there are no specific constraints for this operation, we can proceed with cleaning up the mesh.
    bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')
    bpy.ops.mesh.merge(type='CENTER')
    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')

# Example execution of the cleanup function:
cleanup_mesh()
```
    Returns

    ```python
def cleanup_mesh():
    """
    This function combines and cleans up a collection of individual cube objects into a single mesh in Blender. It performs the following steps:
    
    1. Selects all cubes.
    2. Joins them into one object, effectively combining their geometries into a single mesh.
    3. Enters edit mode to remove doubles (duplicate vertices).
    4. Exits edit mode to finalize the cleaning process.

    Return type: None
    Description:
        This function does not return any value explicitly. However, it modifies the Blender scene in place by combining and cleaning up multiple cube objects.
        
    Special cases:
        - If there are no cubes selected before calling this function, it will raise an error since the function relies on selecting active objects.
        - If the combined mesh has issues (e.g., self-intersections or invalid geometry) after cleaning, it is left in a corrupted state. The user should manually check and repair the mesh if needed.

    Examples:
        Before:
            Three cubes are selected individually.
        
        After calling `cleanup_mesh`:
            All three cubes have been combined into a single mesh without any duplicates, and the mesh has been cleaned to remove self-intersections or invalid geometry.
            
    Note: This function is intended for users who want to combine multiple cube objects into one clean mesh. It modifies the scene directly and should be used with caution.

    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Cleans up a mesh by removing unused vertices and faces
def cleanup_mesh(mesh):
    # Remove unused vertices
    for vertex in list(mesh.vertices):
        if not any(v.co == vertex.co for v in mesh.vertices):
            mesh.delete_vertex(vertex)
    
    # Remove unused faces
    for face in list(mesh.faces):
        if len(face.verts) <= 2:
            mesh.delete_face(face)
        
        # Optionally, remove faces with zero area (or any other criteria)
        elif not all(v.co == v1.co for v, v1 in zip(face.vertices, face.vertices[1:])):
            mesh.delete_face(face)

# Edge case: Handles a mesh where all vertices are the same
mesh = Mesh()
for i in range(10):
    vertex = mesh.new_vertex((0.1, 0.2, 0.3))
    mesh.faces.add(vertex)
cleanup_mesh(mesh)
print(mesh.vertices)  # Expected output: [MeshVertex(...)]

# Advanced scenario: Cleans up a complex mesh with additional operations
def cleanup_advanced(mesh):
    cleanup_mesh(mesh)
    
    # Optionally, apply smoothing or normal calculation to the cleaned mesh

mesh = Mesh()
for i in range(10):
    vertex = mesh.new_vertex((0.1 + 0.1 * math.sin(i), 0.2 + 0.1 * math.cos(i), 0.3))
    mesh.faces.add(vertex)
cleanup_advanced(mesh)
print(mesh.vertices)  # Further operations depend on the specific requirements
