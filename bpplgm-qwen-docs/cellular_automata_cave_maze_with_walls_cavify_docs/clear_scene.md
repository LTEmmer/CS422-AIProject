# clear_scene

    Purpose

    The `clear_scene()` function in Blender removes all objects from the scene by switching to Object Mode, selecting all objects, and then deleting them without using a global context. It is used to clear the current scene of any existing objects for re-importing or resetting purposes.
    Parameters

    ```python
def clear_scene():
    """
    Remove all objects from the scene in Blender.

    This function switches to Object Mode, selects all objects, and then deletes them. It does not use a global context to avoid affecting other scenes or objects.
    
    Usage:
        # Switch to Object Mode
        bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')

        # Select all objects
        bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')

        # Delete selected objects
        bpy.ops.object.delete(use_global=False)
    """
```
    Returns

    ```python
def clear_scene():
    """
    Clears the current Blender scene by switching to Object Mode, selecting all objects,
    and deleting them without using a global context. This is useful for re-importing or resetting a scene.

    Returns:
        None

    Special Cases:
        - If the scene has no objects, no action is taken.
        - If an error occurs during execution (e.g., if Blender is not running), this function will return without any output.
        - If the user cancels the operation at any point, the function will return without deleting anything.

    Usage Example:
    clear_scene()
    """

The `clear_scene()` function in Blender removes all objects from the current scene by switching to Object Mode, selecting all objects, and then deleting them. It is used for re-importing or resetting scenes. The function does not use a global context and returns `None`. Special cases include when there are no objects in the scene, errors during execution, or user cancellation.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Clears all scene objects and sets background color to black
def clear_scene():
    """
    Clears all objects in the current scene. Sets the background color to black.
    
    :return: None
    """
    # Assuming scene_objects is a list containing all objects in the scene
    for obj in scene_objects:
        obj.delete()
    # Setting the background color of the scene
    set_background_color('black')

# Edge case: Attempting to clear a non-existent object should have no effect
def edge_case_clear_nonexistent_object():
    """
    Attempts to clear an object that does not exist in the scene. This should not
    result in any changes.

    :return: None
    """
    # Assuming 'non_existent_obj' is an ID or reference to a non-existent object
    clear_scene()
    obj_exists = False  # Assuming this function checks if an object exists by its ID
    if not obj_exists:
        print("No object found to clear.")

# Advanced scenario: Clearing the scene and then adding new objects with specific properties
def advanced_scenario():
    """
    Clears all objects from the scene. After clearing, adds a new rectangle object to the scene.
    The rectangle is positioned at (10, 20) with dimensions 30x40 and has a red fill.
