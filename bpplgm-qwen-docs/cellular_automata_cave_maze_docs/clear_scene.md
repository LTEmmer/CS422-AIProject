# clear_scene

    Purpose

    This function, `clear_scene`, clears all objects from the current Blender scene by switching to object mode and deleting them.
    Parameters

    ### Function Purpose: `clear_scene`

This function, `clear_scene`, is designed to clear all objects from the current Blender scene. It achieves this by switching the view mode to object mode and then deleting any selected objects.

### Parameters

`None`

---

### Usage Constraints

- Ensure that you have access to a Blender environment where `clear_scene` can be executed.
- This function should not be used in scripts where maintaining the scene contents is necessary, as it will remove all objects.
- If multiple scenes exist, this function will clear all objects across all scenes.

### Examples

```python
import bpy

# Switch to object mode and delete all selected objects
clear_scene()
```

In this example, `clear_scene()` is called to clear all objects from the current Blender scene.
    Returns

    ```python
def clear_scene():
    """
    Clears all objects from the current Blender scene.

    This function switches to object mode and deletes all objects in the scene.

    Returns:
        None

    Special Cases:
    - If there are no objects in the scene, this function will still return `None`
      without any further action.

    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Clears the current scene by removing all objects and clearing the camera position.

# Explanation:
# The clear_scene function is used to remove all objects and set the camera back to its default position in a 3D game environment.
# This is useful for resetting or transitioning between different scenes without leaving any lingering effects from previous ones.

# Code:
clear_scene()

# Example output: All objects are removed, and the camera returns to its default location.
```

```python
# Edge case: Attempts to clear a scene that has no objects. The function should handle this gracefully without errors.

# Explanation:
# The function should be able to handle cases where there are no objects in the current scene and not attempt to remove them, preventing potential crashes or unexpected behavior.

# Code:
clear_scene()

# Example output: No error occurs, indicating the scene is already cleared.
```

```python
# Advanced scenario: Clears a complex scene with multiple camera angles and different types of objects (e.g., static models, animated sprites).

# Explanation:
# In more advanced scenarios, the clear_scene function might be used to prepare the environment for loading a new map or entering a new level. This could include resetting object positions, removing particles, and setting up different lighting conditions.

# Code:
clear_scene()

# Example output: The scene is cleared of all objects, including static models and animated sprites, with no errors.
```
    Docstring

    """```
This function clears the scene by setting the mode to 'OBJECT', selecting all objects, and then deleting them without using global coordinates. If the 'object.mode_set' operator can be executed, it performs these operations.

```python
def clear_scene():
    if bpy.ops.object.mode_set.poll():
        bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')
        bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')
        bpy.ops.object.delete(use_global=False)
