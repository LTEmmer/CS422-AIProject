# generate_map

    Purpose

    The function `generate_map` creates a new level map, sets it up with random values using the `initialize_map` function, and then runs the Game of Life simulation for a specified number of iterations using the `perform_game_of_life_iteration` function. The resulting state of the cellmap after all iterations is returned.
    Parameters

    ```python
def generate_map(size, initial_state=None):
    """
    Generates a new level map with a specified size and performs the Game of Life simulation.

    Args:
        size (int): The dimensions of the cellmap to be created. Must be a positive integer.

        initial_state (list of lists of int, optional): 
            An initial state for the cellmap, represented as a 2D list where each element is either 0 or 1.
            If provided, it should have dimensions equal to 'size'. If not provided, a random state is used.

    Returns:
        list of lists of int: The final state of the cellmap after running the Game of Life simulation for `iterations` times.

    Usage Constraints:
        - `size` must be a positive integer.
        - `initial_state` must be a 2D list if provided, with dimensions equal to `size`.
    """
```

### Examples:

```python
# Example 1: Default initial state
map_size = 5
result_map = generate_map(map_size)
print(result_map)

# Example 2: Custom initial state
custom_initial_state = [
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0]
]
result_custom_map = generate_map(map_size, custom_initial_state)
print(result_custom_map)
```
    Returns

    ```python
def generate_map(iterations):
    """
    Generates a new level map for a simulation.

    The function initializes the cellmap with random values using the `initialize_map` function,
    then runs the Game of Life simulation for a specified number of iterations using the
    `perform_game_of_life_iteration` function. Finally, it returns the resulting state of
    the cellmap after all iterations have completed.

    Args:
        iterations (int): The number of iterations to perform in the Game of Life simulation.

    Returns:
        list: A 2D list representing the cellmap at the end of the simulations.

    Special cases:
        - If iterations is 0, an empty cellmap (a list of lists with no elements) will be returned.
    """
    # Initialize the cellmap with random values
    cellmap = initialize_map()
    
    # Perform the Game of Life simulation for the specified number of iterations
    if iterations > 0:
        perform_game_of_life_iteration(cellmap, iterations)

    Examples

    # Basic usage
```python
# This is a basic example to generate a map using the 'generate_map' function. It creates a new map with the given dimensions and fills it with random values between 0 and 1.
import numpy as np

# Generate a 5x5 map with random values
map_data = generate_map(5, 5)
print(map_data)

# Explanation:
# The 'generate_map' function takes two arguments: width and height. It returns a 2D NumPy array of shape (width, height) filled with random numbers between 0 and 1.
```

# Edge case
```python
# This example demonstrates the behavior of 'generate_map' when called with non-integer dimensions.
try:
    # Generate a map with non-integer width and height
    map_data = generate_map(4.5, 6)
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)

# Explanation:
# The 'generate_map' function raises a TypeError if the provided dimensions are not integers. In this example, calling it with non-integer values results in an error message.
```

# Advanced scenario (if applicable)
```python
# This example shows how to use 'generate_map' for more complex operations, such as generating a map based on probabilities and thresholds.
import numpy as np

# Define probabilities for each cell
probabilities = np.random.rand(10, 10) * 2

# Use the probabilities to generate a new map with binary values (True or False)
binary_map = generate_map(10, 10, probabilities)
print(binary_map)

# Explanation:
# The 'generate_map' function can also take an additional argument for probabilities. It creates a new map where each cell is True if its value is greater than or equal to a threshold set by the probabilities array.
```
