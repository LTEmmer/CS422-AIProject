# initialize_map

    Purpose

    This function initializes a two-dimensional list `initial_map` with dimensions `WIDTH` by `HEIGHT`. Each element of the map is created by calling the `alive_calc()` function and assigning its result. The purpose of this code is to create an initial state for a grid-based simulation, where each cell in the grid is either alive or dead based on the output of the `alive_calc()` function.
    Parameters

    ```python
def initialize_map(initial_map):
    """
    Initialize a two-dimensional list `initial_map` with dimensions `WIDTH` by `HEIGHT`.

    Args:
        initial_map (list): The two-dimensional list to be initialized.

    Returns:
        None: The function modifies the `initial_map` in place.

    Usage Constraints:
        - `initial_map` must be a 2D list where each cell can hold a value that represents the state of a grid element.
        - The initial state is determined by calling the `alive_calc()` function for each cell and assigning its result to the corresponding position in `initial_map`.

    Examples:
    >>> initialize_map([[None] * WIDTH] * HEIGHT)
    >>> # This will create a two-dimensional list with `WIDTH` columns and `HEIGHT` rows,
    >>> # where each element is set to None. The purpose of this list will be to store the state
    >>> # of grid elements, which is determined by calling the alive_calc() function for each cell.
    """
```
    Returns

    ```python
def initialize_map():
    """
    Initializes a two-dimensional list `initial_map` with dimensions WIDTH by HEIGHT. 
    Each element of the map is created by calling the alive_calc() function and assigning its result.

    Returns:
        initial_map (list): A 2D list where each element represents the state of a cell in the grid.
                          The value can be either True or False, indicating whether the cell is alive or dead.
                          
    Special Cases:
        - If WIDTH or HEIGHT is not provided during function call, it defaults to 10 for both dimensions.
        - Each cell's state is based on the output of the alive_calc() function, which simulates a simple cell-based life simulation algorithm.

    Examples:
        >>> initialize_map(WIDTH=5, HEIGHT=3)
        [[False, True, False, True, False], [True, False, True, False, True], [False, True, False, True, False]]
    """
    # Implementation of the function as described
```

In this version of the `initialize_map` function:
- The return type is explicitly stated as a list.
- A description of what each element in the list represents (alive or dead cells) is provided.
- Special cases are mentioned, including default dimensions and how each cell's state is determined by the `alive_calc()` function.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Initialize a map with key-value pairs.
initialize_map = {
    'key1': 'value1',
    'key2': 'value2'
}

print(initialize_map)

# Edge case: Initialize an empty map.
empty_map = {}

print(empty_map)

# Advanced scenario: Initialize a nested map.
nested_map = {
    'parent_key': {
        'child_key1': 'child_value1',
        'child_key2': 'child_value2'
    }
}

print(nested_map)
```
    Docstring

    """```python
def initialize_map():
    """
    Initializes a map with random living cells based on predefined WIDTH and HEIGHT.

    Args:
        None

    Returns:
        list: A 2D list representing the initial map state, where 'alive_calc()' is called for each cell to determine its status.

    Examples:
        >>> initialize_map()
        [[False, False, True, False],
         [True, True, False, False],
         [False, True, False, True]]
        
        The `alive_calc()` function is responsible for determining the live state of each cell.
