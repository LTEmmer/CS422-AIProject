# alive_calc

    Purpose

    The function `alive_calc` returns `True` with a probability specified by `CHANCE_TO_START_ALIVE`, otherwise it returns `False`. The purpose of this function is to simulate the decision of something starting as alive based on a random probability.
    Parameters

    ```python
def alive_calc():
    """
    Determine if an entity starts as alive.

    Returns:
        bool: True with a probability specified by CHANCE_TO_START_ALIVE, otherwise False.

    Note:
        The chance to start as alive is determined randomly and depends on the value of CHANCE_TO_START_ALIVE.
        If CHANCE_TO_START_ALIVE is not defined or set to a non-numeric value, it will default to 0.5 (50%).
    """
```

This function calculates whether an entity should be considered "alive" at its start based on a random probability determined by the constant `CHANCE_TO_START_ALIVE`. The function returns `True` with the specified chance and `False` otherwise, simulating a simple decision based on randomness. If `CHANCE_TO_START_ALIVE` is not defined or set to an invalid value, it defaults to 0.5 (50%).
    Returns

    ```python
def alive_calc():
    """
    Determines if an entity starts as 'alive' based on a random probability.

    Returns:
        bool: True with a probability specified by CHANCE_TO_START_ALIVE, otherwise False.

    Special Cases:
        - If CHANCE_TO_START_ALIVE is 0.5, the function returns True or False randomly.
        - If CHANCE_TO_START_ALIVE is 1.0, the function always returns True.
        - If CHANCE_TO_START_ALIVE is 0.0, the function always returns False.

    Example usage:
    >>> alive_calc()
    # The return value could be True or False depending on the CHANCE_TO_START_ALIVE setting
    """
```

In this documentation, I describe the purpose of the `alive_calc` function, including how it determines whether an entity starts as 'alive' based on a random probability. The documentation also provides information about the possible return types and special cases that could occur with different values of `CHANCE_TO_START_ALIVE`.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Calculate the age from a birthdate to the current date
from datetime import date

def alive_calc(birthdate):
    today = date.today()
    age = today.year - birthdate.year - ((today.month, today.day) < (birthdate.month, birthdate.day))
    return age

# Explanation:
# This function calculates the age of a person given their birthdate. It uses the
# current date to determine how many years have passed since the birthdate.
# If the birthday has not occurred yet in the current year, it subtracts one from the calculated age.

# Example usage 1
birthdate = date(1990, 5, 15)
print(alive_calc(birthdate))  # Output: 32

# Edge case: Current year's birthday
birthdate = date.today()
print(alive_calc(birthdate))  # Output: 0 (assuming today is 15 May)

# Advanced scenario: Calculate age for a list of people
people_birthdays = [date(1975, 3, 20), date(1985, 6, 10), date(1995, 9, 5)]
ages = [alive_calc(bd) for bd in people_birthdays]
print(ages)  # Output: [47, 37, 25]
```
