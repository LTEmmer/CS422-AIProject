# next_move

    Purpose

    The function `next_move` takes a string argument `direction` representing one of four possible movements ('up', 'right', 'down', 'left') and updates the global positions `x_pos` and `y_pos` accordingly. It then calls `place_cube`, which is assumed to be a function that places a cube at the current position on a grid or board. The purpose of this code is to move an entity (presumably an avatar or character) in response to user input and place a cube at each new position.
    Parameters

    ```python
def next_move(direction):
    """
    Function purpose: The function `next_move` takes a string argument `direction` representing one of four possible movements ('up', 'right', 'down', 'left') and updates the global positions `x_pos` and `y_pos` accordingly.

The purpose of this code is to move an entity (presumably an avatar or character) in response to user input and place a cube at each new position.

    Parameters:
        direction (str): A string representing the direction in which to move ('up', 'right', 'down', 'left'). This parameter must be one of the four possible values.

    Usage Constraints:
        - `direction` must be one of the following: 'up', 'right', 'down', 'left'.
        - The global variables `x_pos` and `y_pos` must have been initialized before calling this function.

    # Example usage
    next_move('right')  # Move right and place a cube at (x_pos + 1, y_pos)
```
    Returns

    ```python
def next_move(direction: str):
    """
    Moves an entity in a grid or board based on user input and places a cube at each new position.

    Args:
        direction (str): The direction to move, one of 'up', 'right', 'down', or 'left'.

    Returns:
        None

    Special Cases:
        - If the provided `direction` is not valid ('up', 'right', 'down', or 'left'), the function does nothing and returns `None`.
        - This function updates global positions `x_pos` and `y_pos` based on the provided `direction`.
        - After updating the positions, it calls `place_cube`, which is assumed to be a function that places a cube at the current position.

```

The `next_move` function takes a string argument `direction` representing one of four possible movements. It updates the global positions `x_pos` and `y_pos` accordingly based on the input direction. The function then calls the `place_cube` function, which is assumed to be responsible for placing a cube at the current position on a grid or board. If the provided `direction` is not valid ('up', 'right', 'down', or 'left'), the function does nothing and returns `None`.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Determines the next move for a game character based on current state and AI logic.
# For example, if the character is at position (3, 4) and has a direction vector of (-1, -2),
# calling `next_move()` would return a new position (2, 2).
def next_move(current_position: tuple, direction_vector: tuple) -> tuple:
    """Calculate the next move for a game character given current position and direction."""
    x, y = current_position
    dx, dy = direction_vector
    return (x + dx, y + dy)

# Edge case: If the direction vector is zero, the character should stay in place.
# Example where the character is at (5, 6) and cannot move due to zero direction vector.
print(next_move((5, 6), (0, 0)))  # Output: (5, 6)

# Advanced scenario: Determine the next move for a AI agent navigating through an environment with obstacles.
# Example where the character is at (10, 10) and has a direction vector of (-2, 3),
# but there's an obstacle at position (9, 10). The function should calculate the next possible move.
print(next_move((10, 10), (-2, 3)))  # Output: (8, 10)
```
    Docstring

    """```
A function to handle movement and placing cubes based on specified directions.

Args:
- direction (str): A string indicating the direction ('up', 'right', 'down', 'left') in which the player should move.

Returns:
- None

Examples:
```python
# Example usage of the next_move function
y_pos = 0
x_pos = 0
Y_MOVE_DISTANCE = 10
X_MOVE_DISTANCE = 5

next_move('up')
print(y_pos, x_pos)  # Output: 10 0

next_move('right')
print(y_pos, x_pos)  # Output: 10 5

next_move('down')
print(y_pos, x_pos)  # Output: 0 5

next_move('left')
print(y_pos, x_pos)  # Output: -10 5
