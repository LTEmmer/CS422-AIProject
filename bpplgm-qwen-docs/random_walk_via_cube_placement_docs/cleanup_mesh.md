# cleanup_mesh

    Purpose

    The function `cleanup_mesh` in Blender's Python API is designed to clean up a set of separate cube objects by joining them into one object, removing overlapping vertices, and then de-selecting the "floor" and "ceiling" faces based on their normal vectors. It leaves behind a hollow mesh structure.
    Parameters

    ```python
def cleanup_mesh(context):
    """
    Function to clean up a set of separate cube objects in Blender's Python API.

    Parameters:
        context (bpy.context): The current state and configuration of Blender.

    Returns:
        None: This function does not return any value.

    # Join all the individual cubes into one object
    bpy.ops.object.join()

    # Remove overlapping vertices from the mesh

    # Select and delete the "floor" face based on its normal vector
    for obj in context.scene.objects:
        if obj.type == 'MESH' and obj.name.endswith("floor"):
            obj.select_set(True)
            bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='EDIT')
            bpy.ops.mesh.delete(type='FACE')

    # Select and delete the "ceiling" face based on its normal vector
    for obj in context.scene.objects:
        if obj.type == 'MESH' and obj.name.endswith("ceiling"):
            obj.select_set(True)
            bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='EDIT')

    # De-select all objects to reset the user interface
    bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='DESELECT')
```

In this function, `cleanup_mesh`, the purpose is to clean up a set of separate cube objects by joining them into one object, removing overlapping vertices, and then de-selecting specific faces based on their normal vectors. The function returns `None` as it does not return any value.
    Returns

    ```python
def cleanup_mesh(selected_objects):
    """
    Cleans up a set of separate cube objects by joining them into one object,
    removing overlapping vertices, and then de-selecting the "floor" and "ceiling"
    faces based on their normal vectors. It leaves behind a hollow mesh structure.

    Parameters:
    - selected_objects: A list of Blender Object instances that are assumed to be
      cube objects that need cleanup.

    Returns:
    - None

    Special Cases:
    - If the input list is empty or contains objects other than cubes, it will not
      perform any cleanup operations.
    """
```

**Explanation**:
The `cleanup_mesh` function takes a list of Blender Object instances as input. It assumes these objects are cube shapes. The function joins all these separate cubes into one object by performing the following steps:

1. **Joining Objects**: All objects in the input list are joined into a single mesh.
2. **Removing Overlapping Vertices**: Any vertices that are duplicated across multiple cubes are removed, ensuring that each vertex is unique to one cube.
3. **De-selecting Floor and Ceiling Faces**: The function identifies faces with normals pointing upwards or downwards, assuming these should be the "floor" and "ceiling" of a building-like structure. These faces are then deselected.

After processing, the cleanup_mesh function leaves behind a hollow mesh structure, where each cube's original face is retained as an edge, creating a void between them. The function returns `None` to indicate it has completed its operations without explicitly returning a value.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Cleans up a mesh by removing unnecessary vertices and faces.
mesh = cleanup_mesh(mesh)

# Edge case: Mesh with no edges to remove.
mesh = cleanup_mesh(mesh)  # No changes made as there are no edges.

# Advanced scenario: Handles meshes with multiple connected components by cleaning each one separately.
cleaned_meshes = [cleanup_mesh(mesh) for mesh in split_into_connected_components(original_mesh)]
```
    Docstring

    """```python
def cleanup_mesh():
    """
    Cleans up a mesh by joining all selected cubes into one object,
    removing overlapping vertices and floor/ceiling faces, leaving a hollow mesh behind.
    
    Args:
        None
        
    Returns:
        None
    
    Examples:
    # Select multiple cube objects in Blender.
    bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='TOGGLE')
    bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='TOGGLE')
    cleanup_mesh()
    ```

This function assumes that the user has selected multiple cube objects in Blender before calling `cleanup_mesh()`. It joins these cubes into one object, removes overlapping vertices to ensure smooth edges, and then deletes all faces that are parallel to the floor or ceiling to leave a hollow mesh."""
