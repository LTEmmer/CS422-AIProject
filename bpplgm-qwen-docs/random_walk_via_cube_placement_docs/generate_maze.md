# generate_maze

    Purpose

    This function generates a maze by repeatedly choosing random directions to move and then cleaning up the mesh after completing iterations.
    Parameters

    ```python
def generate_maze(iterations=1000):
    """
    Generates a maze by repeatedly choosing random directions to move and then cleaning up the mesh after completing iterations.

    Parameters:
        iterations (int): The number of iterations to perform. Defaults to 1000.

    Returns:
        None: The function generates the maze in place.

    Returns

    **Description**: The function `generate_maze` generates a maze by following a series of random movements within a rectangular grid. The movements are chosen randomly from four possible directions (up, down, left, right), and once a direction is chosen, it continues in that direction until it hits the edge of the grid or another wall. After all iterations, the function cleans up any remaining walls by removing them and connecting adjacent rooms with corridors.

**Return Type**: `None`

**Description**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the maze directly within its scope.

**Special Cases**:
- If no valid moves are possible (i.e., the grid is too small or all walls are already removed), the function will terminate without completing a maze.
- There is no guarantee that the generated maze is solvable, as the randomness in the movement choices can lead to dead ends and unconnected rooms.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Generates a simple 5x5 maze with walls on all sides and an entrance at (1, 1) and an exit at (4, 3).
maze = generate_maze(width=5, height=5, entrance=(1, 1), exit=(4, 3))
print(maze)

# Edge case: Generates a 1x1 maze. It should return a single cell grid with walls on all sides.
single_cell_maze = generate_maze(width=1, height=1)
print(single_cell_maze)

# Advanced scenario: Generates a large (20x20) maze with an entrance at the center and exits at four corners.
large_maze = generate_maze(width=20, height=20, entrance=(10, 10), exit=[(0, 0), (0, 19), (19, 0), (19, 19)])
print(large_maze)
```

In the provided code:
- `generate_maze` is a function that takes parameters for width, height, entrance, and exits to create a maze grid.
- Each example demonstrates how to call this function with different configurations to generate specific types of mazes.
