# connect_rooms

    Purpose

    This function connects two rooms by finding a path between them on a map, setting the tile type at each step of the path to 't', and marking both rooms as connected if the `good` parameter is True. It randomly selects starting points within each room and iterates towards each other until they meet, setting tiles along their path to 1 (indicating a passage).
    Parameters

    ```python
def connect_rooms(self, room, closest_room, good):
    """
    Connects two rooms by finding a path between them on the map.

    Args:
        self (object): The current object instance.
        room (Room): The first room to be connected.
        closest_room (Room): The second room to be connected.
        good (bool): If True, marks both rooms as connected.

    Description:
        This function connects two rooms by finding a path between them on the map. It sets the tile type
        at each step of the path to 't' and if `good` is True, it marks both rooms as connected.
        It randomly selects starting points within each room and iterates towards each other until they meet,
        setting tiles along their path to 1 (indicating a passage).
    """
```
    Returns

    The `connect_rooms` function does not return any value. It performs operations on a map to connect two rooms by finding a path between them and setting tiles along the way, modifying the tile types and marking rooms as connected if specified. Special cases include handling situations where no valid connection can be found or when the map is too small for a direct connection to be possible.

```python
def connect_rooms(map_data, room1_id, room2_id, good=True):
    """
    Connects two rooms on the map by finding a path between them and setting tiles along the way.
    
    Parameters:
    - map_data: A 2D list representing the game map.
    - room1_id: The ID of the first room to connect.
    - room2_id: The ID of the second room to connect.
    - good: A boolean indicating whether to mark rooms as connected if True.

    The function sets tile types along a path between the two rooms and marks them as connected
    if specified. It returns nothing since it modifies the map in place.
    
    Special cases:
    - If no valid path can be found or if the map is too small for a direct connection,
      the function does not return an error but does not modify the map.
    """
```

### Examples:

```python
map_data = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0]
]

connect_rooms(map_data, 1, 3)

# After execution:
print(map_data)
```

This will modify the `map_data` to indicate a path between rooms 1 and 3 by setting tiles along the way.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Connect two rooms in a building with a door between them.
rooms = ['Room1', 'Room2']
connect_rooms(rooms, 0, 1)
print("Rooms connected: Room1 and Room2")
```

```python
# Edge case: Attempt to connect a room that does not exist.
rooms = ['Room1']
try:
    connect_rooms(rooms, 0, -1)
except IndexError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

```python
# Advanced scenario: Connect multiple rooms in different buildings with doors between them.
buildings = [ ['BuildingA', 'RoomA1', 'RoomA2'], ['BuildingB', 'RoomB1'] ]
connect_rooms(buildings, 0, 3)
print("Rooms connected: RoomA1 and RoomB1")
```
