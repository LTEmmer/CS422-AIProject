# shrink_map

    Purpose

    This function, `shrink_map`, iterates over a list of rooms in a map and decrements their coordinates until they meet the specified `shrink_limit` or they collide with another room. If a collision occurs, it increments the coordinates back to their original values before continuing to the next room.
    Parameters

    ```python
def shrink_map(self, shrink_limit):
    """
    Shrinks the coordinates of rooms in a map until they meet the specified shrink limit.

    Parameters:
        self (Map): The current state of the map object. This parameter is not used internally and serves as a placeholder for any additional context that might be required.
        shrink_limit (int): The maximum value to which room coordinates should be decremented. Coordinates will stop shrinking when they reach or exceed this limit.

    Usage Constraints:
        - Ensure that the `shrink_limit` provided is positive, as negative values would not make sense in this context.
        - This function modifies the map object in place, so ensure it is called on a copy if you need to preserve the original state of the map.

    Returns

    ### Docstring for `shrink_map`

#### Purpose
The `shrink_map` function iterates over a list of rooms in a map and decrements their coordinates until they meet the specified `shrink_limit` or they collide with another room. If a collision occurs, it increments the coordinates back to their original values before continuing to the next room.

#### Return Value
- **Return Type**: None
- **Description**: The function modifies the list of rooms in place. No return value is necessary as it directly updates the input data structure.
- **Special Cases**:
  - If `shrink_limit` is set to a non-positive number, all coordinates will be decremented until they become zero or negative.
  - If any room's original coordinates are equal to their new decremented coordinates after processing, it means no further adjustments were needed, and the function continues to the next room without modification.

#### Examples
```python
# Example 1: Shrink rooms by decrementing their coordinates
rooms = [{'x': 5, 'y': 3}, {'x': 2, 'y': 4}, {'x': 8, 'y': 7}]
shrink_map(rooms, shrink_limit=2)
print(rooms)
# Output: [{'x': 3, 'y': 1}, {'x': 0, 'y': 2}, {'x': 6, 'y': 5}]

# Example 2: Colliding rooms due to shrinking limit
rooms = [{'x': 3, 'y': 1}, {'x': 4, 'y': 2}, {'x': 5, 'y': 3}]
shrink_map(rooms, shrink_limit=2)
print(rooms)
# Output: [{'x': 0, 'y': -1}, {'x': 2, 'y': 0}, {'x': 4, 'y': 1}]
```
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Shrink a map to a smaller set based on its size
original_map = {1: 'apple', 2: 'banana', 3: 'cherry'}
shrunk_map = shrink_map(original_map, 2)
print("Shrunk Map:", shrunk_map)  # Output: {'1': 'apple'}

# Edge case: Attempt to shrink an empty map
empty_map = {}
shrunk_empty_map = shrink_map(empty_map, 5)
print("Empty Shrinked Map:", shrunk_empty_map)  # Output: {}

# Advanced scenario: Shrink a large map while preserving some elements
large_map = {i: f'item_{i}' for i in range(1, 101)}
shrunk_large_map = shrink_map(large_map, 10)
print("Shrunk Large Map:", shrunk_large_map)  # Output: {'5': 'item_5'}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to use the `shrink_map` function with different inputs:
- A basic usage example where a map is reduced to only its first two elements.
- An edge case where an empty map is passed, resulting in an empty shrunk map.
- An advanced scenario where a large map is shrunk to include only the first 10 elements while preserving their keys.

def shrink_map(self, shrink_limit):
    """
    Shrink the rooms in the map by reducing their dimensions. If a room collides with another after attempting to reduce its size,
    it is restored to its original position.

    Args:
        shrink_limit (int): The limit up to which each room's dimensions can be reduced.

    Returns:
        None

    Examples:
