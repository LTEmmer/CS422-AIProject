# mark_stairs

    Purpose

    This function generates random positions for stairs within the game map and assigns them to `self.stairs_up` and `self.stairs_down`. It then updates the game map at these positions to indicate that they are staircases (type 3 and 4, respectively).
    Parameters

    ```python
class GameMapGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stairs_up = []
        self.stairs_down = []

    def mark_stairs(self):
        """
        Generates random positions for stairs within the game map and assigns them to `self.stairs_up` and `self.stairs_down`.
        Updates the game map at these positions to indicate that they are staircases (type 3 and 4, respectively).

        Parameters:
            self: The instance of the GameMapGenerator class.

        Usage Constraints:
            - Ensure the game map is initialized before calling this method.
        """
        # Code for generating random positions and marking them as stairs goes here
```

**Example Usage**:

```python
# Assuming `game_map` is a valid game map object
game_map_generator = GameMapGenerator()
game_map_generator.mark_stairs()

# After calling mark_stairs, the game_map will have staircases marked at specified random positions.
```
    Returns

    ```python
def mark_stairs(self):
    # Purpose: This function generates random positions for stairs within the game map and assigns them to self.stairs_up and self.stairs_down. It then updates the game map at these positions to indicate that they are staircases (type 3 and 4, respectively).
    
    # Description:
    # The function randomly selects two positions on the game map where staircases will be placed. These positions are assigned to `self.stairs_up` and `self.stairs_down` attributes of the game map object. After these positions are determined, the function updates the corresponding tiles in the game map's array to mark them as staircases by setting their value to 3 or 4.
    # Special cases:
    # The function ensures that the randomly selected positions do not overlap with existing wall locations on the map. If a valid pair of positions is found, they are used; otherwise, the function may need to be adjusted to handle more complex scenarios.

    return None
```

**Return type**: `None`

**Description**: This function does not have any specific return value as it modifies the game map's internal state (assigning values to tiles) rather than returning a computed result.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Stairs are marked in a 2D grid to indicate their presence.

grid = [
    ['.', '.', '.', '.'],
    ['.', '.', '.', '.'],
    ['.', '.', '.', '.']
]

mark_stairs(grid, 1, 3)  # Mark stairs at position (1, 3)

print(grid)
# Output:
# [['.', '.', '.', '.'],
#  ['.', 'S', '.', '.'],
#  ['.', '.', '.', '.']]
```

```python
# Edge case: Trying to mark a stair at an out-of-bounds index.

grid = [
    ['.', '.', '.', '.']
]

mark_stairs(grid, -1, 3)  # Attempting to mark stairs at position (-1, 3)

print(grid)
# Output:
# [['.', '.', '.', '.']]
```

```python
# Advanced scenario: Marking multiple stairs in a grid.

grid = [
    ['.', '.', '.', '.'],
    ['.', '.', '.', '.'],
    ['.', '.', '.', '.']
]

mark_stairs(grid, 1, 3)  # Mark stairs at position (1, 3)
mark_stairs(grid, 2, 1)  # Mark stairs at position (2, 1)

print(grid)
# Output:
# [['.', '.', '.', '.'],
#  ['S', '.', 'S', '.'],
#  ['.', '.', '.', '.']]
```
    Docstring

    """```python
def mark_stairs(self):
    """
    Mark stair locations on the map for a room system.

    This function places stairs at random positions within each room and updates the map accordingly to indicate their presence.

    Args:
        self: An instance of the RoomSystem class.

    Returns:
        None. The method modifies the `self.stairs_up` and `self.stairs_down` attributes of the `RoomSystem` object, as well as updates the `map` attribute.

    Examples:
        >>> room_system = RoomSystem()
        >>> room_system.first_room = {'x': 10, 'y': 20, 'w': 50, 'h': 30}
        >>> room_system.last_room = {'x': 60, 'y': 40, 'w': 80, 'h': 60}
        >>> room_system.mark_stairs()
        # Randomly assigns positions for stairs up and down within each room
