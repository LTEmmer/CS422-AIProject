# find_farthest

    Purpose

    The function `find_farthest` calculates the pair of rooms that are farthest apart based on their center coordinates. It iterates through all pairs of rooms, computes the Manhattan distance between their centers, and keeps track of the pair with the maximum distance. The first and last room in this pair are stored as properties of the object `self`.
    Parameters

    ```python
class RoomLocator:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize properties to store the farthest room pair and its maximum distance
        self.farthest_room_pair = None
        self.max_distance = float('-inf')

    def find_farthest(self):
        """
        Calculate the pair of rooms that are farthest apart based on their center coordinates.

        The function iterates through all pairs of rooms, computes the Manhattan distance between their centers,
        and keeps track of the pair with the maximum distance. The first and last room in this pair
        are stored as properties of the object `self`.

        This method does not modify any external variables but sets internal properties to store
        the farthest room pair and its maximum distance.

        # Implementation would go here, but it is not provided in the given code snippet
```
    Returns

    ```python

    """

    Returns:
        None

    Special cases:
        - If there are no rooms, the function returns without setting any properties.
        - If there is only one room, the function sets both `first_room` and `last_room` to that room.
        - If multiple pairs have the same maximum distance, the first pair encountered in the iteration is selected as the farthest apart.

    Examples

    ```python
# Purpose: Find the farthest item from a given start index in a list using binary search

def find_farthest(lst, start_idx):
    # Explanation: This function takes a list and an index as input. It finds the index of the element that is the farthest from the given start index.
    # If there are multiple elements equidistant from the start index, it returns the one with the highest index.

# Basic usage
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
start_index = 2
result = find_farthest(my_list, start_index)
print(f"The farthest element from index {start_index} is at index {result}, with value {my_list[result]}.")

# Edge case: List with all equal elements
all_equal_list = [1, 1, 1, 1]
edge_start_index = 0
edge_result = find_farthest(all_equal_list, edge_start_index)
print(f"The farthest element from index {edge_start_index} is at index {edge_result}, with value {all_equal_list[edge_result]}.")

# Advanced scenario: List with negative indices and positive numbers
neg_pos_list = [5, -3, 7, -1, 9]
advanced_start_index = 2
advanced_result = find_farthest(neg_pos_list, advanced_start_index)
print(f"The farthest element from index {advanced_start_index} is at index {advanced_result}, with value {neg_pos_list[advanced_result]}.")
