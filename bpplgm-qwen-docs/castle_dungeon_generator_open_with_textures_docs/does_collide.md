# does_collide

    Purpose

    The `does_collide` method checks if a given room collides with any other room in the list of rooms stored in the object. It compares the dimensions and positions of the two rooms to determine if they overlap in any part of their space. If a collision is detected, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
    Parameters

    ```python
class RoomMap:
    def does_collide(self, room):
        """
        Checks if the given room collides with any other room in the list of rooms stored in the object.

        Args:
            self (RoomMap): The instance of the RoomMap class.
            room (Room): A Room object representing the room to check for collisions.

        Returns:
            bool: True if a collision is detected, False otherwise.
        """
        # Iterate over all other rooms in the list
        for other_room in self.rooms:
            # Compare dimensions and positions of the two rooms
            if (self.rect.colliderect(other_room.rect) or
                self.rect.right > other_room.rect.left or
                self.rect.bottom > other_room.rect.top or
                self.rect.left < other_room.rect.right or
                self.rect.top < other_room.rect.bottom):
                return True
        return False

    # Example usage of does_collide:
    # Assuming room_map is an instance of RoomMap and new_room is a new Room object:
    # result = room_map.does_collide(new_room)
    # if result:
    #     print("Collision detected with existing rooms.")
```

Note: This example assumes that `Room` and `RoomMap` have attributes like `rect` which represent the rectangle bounding box of each room. The collision detection logic checks for overlap between rectangles using the `colliderect` method, as well as direct positional comparisons to account for partial overlaps or adjacent rooms.
    Returns

    ```python
def does_collide(self, other_room):
    """
    Determines if the current room collides with another given room.

    Args:
        other_room (Room): The room to compare against.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the current room collides with other_room; False otherwise.
               A collision is detected if any part of either room's space overlaps.

    Examples:
        >>> room1 = Room(0, 0, 5, 5)
        >>> room2 = Room(4, 4, 5, 5)
        >>> room3 = Room(6, 6, 5, 5)

        >>> room1.does_collide(room2)
        True

        >>> room1.does_collide(room3)
        False
    """
```

This method checks for collision between two rooms by comparing their dimensions and positions. If the space of one room overlaps with another in any way (i.e., if they share any common area), it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The examples provided demonstrate how to use this method with different sets of rooms.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Checks if two rectangles collide based on their coordinates and dimensions.

rect1 = Rectangle(0, 0, 100, 50)
rect2 = Rectangle(50, 25, 75, 75)

if does_collide(rect1, rect2):
    print("Rectangles collide.")
else:
    print("Rectangles do not collide.")

# Edge case: Checking if a rectangle collides with itself.

rect3 = Rectangle(0, 0, 50, 50)
if does_collide(rect3, rect3):
    print("Rectangle collides with itself.")
else:
    print("Rectangle does not collide with itself.")

# Advanced scenario: Handling collision detection in a game loop.

class GameObject:
    def __init__(self, x, y, width, height):
        self.rect = Rectangle(x, y, width, height)

def handle_collision(object1, object2):
    if does_collide(object1.rect, object2.rect):
        # Perform collision response logic
        print("Collision detected between two objects.")
    else:
        print("No collision detected.")

# Example usage in a game loop
player = GameObject(100, 100, 50, 50)
enemy = GameObject(150, 150, 50, 50)

while True:
    handle_collision(player, enemy)
```
In the examples above, `does_collide` is a function that takes two rectangles (or any objects with a `rect` attribute) as input and returns `True` if they collide, otherwise `False`. The function checks for collision by comparing the positions and sizes of the rectangles.
