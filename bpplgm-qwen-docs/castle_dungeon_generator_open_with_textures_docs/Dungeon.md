# Dungeon

    Purpose

    To integrate your Blender script into a Python environment that can handle mesh data and manipulate it using libraries such as `bpy` and `pandas`, you need to ensure that the script is self-contained and can be run in an environment where these libraries are available. Here's how you can structure your Python script:

```python
import bpy
import pandas as pd

# Assuming you have a CSV file containing map data (x, y, t)
csv_file = 'path_to_your_map_data.csv'

def load_map_data(file_path):
    # Load the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    
    # Initialize an empty list to hold the map data as tuples
    map_data = []
    
    # Iterate over each row in the DataFrame
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        x, y, t = row['x'], row['y'], row['t']
        
        # Append a tuple of (x, y, t) to the map data list
        map_data.append((x, y, t))
    
    return map_data

def create_mesh_from_map(map_data):
    # Create a new Blender scene
    bpy.ops.scene.new(name="New Scene")
    
    # Iterate over each point in the map data
    for x, y, t in map_data:
        if t == 2:  # Wall
            # Add a cube for the wall
            bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=2, enter_editmode=False, location=(x, y, 0))
        elif t == 3:  # Beginning
            # Add a sphere for the beginning
            bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_uv_sphere_add(radius=1, enter_editmode=False, location=(x, y, 0))
        elif t == 4:  # End
            # Add a cylinder for the end
            bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cylinder_add(radius=1, enter_editmode=False, location=(x, y, 0))
        else:
            # Floor tile
            bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_plane_add(size=2, enter_editmode=False, location=(x, y, -1))

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    map_data = load_map_data(csv_file)
    create_mesh_from_map(map_data)

```

### Key Points:

1. **Data Loading**: The script uses `pandas` to read a CSV file containing the map data with columns for x, y, and t (type of tile).

2. **Mesh Creation**: It iterates over each point in the loaded data and creates a Blender mesh object based on the type specified by t:
   - Wall: Adds a cube.
   - Beginning: Adds a sphere.
   - End: Adds a cylinder.
   - Floor Tile: Adds a plane.

3. **Scene Management**: A new Blender scene is created for each run of the script, ensuring that objects are not persisted across runs.

4. **Execution**: The script can be executed directly from a Python environment where `bpy` and `pandas` are available.

Make sure you have `bpy` installed in your Python environment (`pip install bpy`) and that your CSV file is correctly formatted with the required columns (`x`, `y`, `t`).
    Docstring

    """The purpose of this Python script is to generate a maze and its associated geometry using Blender. The script includes functions for creating a random maze, connecting rooms, placing stairs at the beginning and end, and generating the final mesh representing the maze and its components (walls, floor tiles, and stairs)."""
