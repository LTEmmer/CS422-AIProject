# generate

    Purpose

    This function generates a maze by creating an initial 2D array with dimensions specified by `x_size` and `y_size`. It then randomly places rooms within the map, ensuring they do not overlap. Each room is assigned a position and size, and the map's pathfinding structure is initialized. The function connects the rooms using the nearest neighbor algorithm, sets the terrain type to 1 for rooms and 2 for walls, and finally adds stairs at the farthest point from any wall.
    Parameters

    ```python
class MazeGenerator:
    """
    Generates a maze by creating an initial 2D array with dimensions specified by x_size and y_size. It then randomly places rooms within the map,
    ensuring they do not overlap. Each room is assigned a position and size, and the map's pathfinding structure is initialized.
    The function connects the rooms using the nearest neighbor algorithm, sets the terrain type to 1 for rooms and 2 for walls, and finally adds stairs at the farthest point from any wall.
    """

    def generate(self, x_size: int, y_size: int) -> None:
        """
        Generates a maze with the specified dimensions.

        Args:
            x_size (int): The width of the maze map.
            y_size (int): The height of the maze map.
        """
```

**Examples using the existing code:**

```python
# Example usage of MazeGenerator class
from my_maze_generator import MazeGenerator

# Create an instance of MazeGenerator
maze_gen = MazeGenerator()

# Generate a maze with dimensions 10x10
maze_gen.generate(10, 10)

# Additional example (not shown in the code)
# maze_gen.get_maze()  # Assuming this method returns the generated maze as a 2D list or similar structure
```

Please note that the `my_maze_generator` module must be defined to use this code snippet, and additional methods like `get_maze()` would need to be implemented in the class to retrieve the generated maze.
    Returns

    ```python
def generate(x_size: int, y_size: int) -> None:
    """
    Generates a maze by creating an initial 2D array with dimensions specified by `x_size` and `y_size`.
    
    This function initializes a map where rooms are randomly placed, ensuring no overlap. Each room is assigned
    a position and size, and the pathfinding structure is initialized. The maze connects rooms using the nearest
    neighbor algorithm, sets terrain type 1 for rooms and 2 for walls, and finally adds stairs at the farthest
    point from any wall.
    
    Parameters:
        x_size (int): The width of the map.
        y_size (int): The height of the map.
        
    Returns:
        None: This function modifies the global maze variable to contain the generated maze.
