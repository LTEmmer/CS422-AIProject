# find_closest

    Purpose

    The function `find_closest` calculates the room closest to a given room based on the center of mass and compares it with other specified rooms. It returns the room that is not in the same group as the specified others if they are provided, and chooses the room with the smallest Manhattan distance to the master room's center of mass.
    Parameters

    ```python
class RoomFinder:
    def find_closest(self, room, others=None):
        """
        Finds the closest room to a given room based on center of mass and compares it with other specified rooms.

        Parameters:
            self: The current instance of the class.
            room (Room): The reference room for which to find the closest room.
            others (List[Room], optional): A list of other rooms to exclude from consideration. Defaults to None.

        Returns:
            Room: The closest room that is not in the same group as 'others' if provided, or the room with the smallest Manhattan distance to the master room's center of mass otherwise.
