# point_collide

    Purpose

    The `point_collide` method checks if a point at coordinates `(x, y)` on the game's map is not occupied by an entity. If the tile type (`'t'`) is 1, indicating it's not an entity, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`, meaning the point can be collided with.
    Parameters

    ```python
def point_collide(self, x: int, y: int) -> bool:
    """
    Check if a point at coordinates (x, y) on the game's map is not occupied by an entity.

    Parameters:
        self (GameMap): The game map object.
        x (int): The x-coordinate of the point to check.
        y (int): The y-coordinate of the point to check.

    Returns:
        bool: False if the tile type ('t') at the given coordinates is 1, indicating it's not an entity. True otherwise.
    """
```

Example usage:

```python
game_map = GameMap()
# Assuming game_map has already been initialized and has tiles set up

if game_map.point_collide(5, 3):  # Check if point (5, 3) is not occupied by an entity
    print("Point can be collided with.")
else:
    print("Point cannot be collided with.")
```
    Returns

    ```python
def point_collide(self, x: int, y: int) -> bool:
    """
    Determine if a point at coordinates (x, y) on the game's map is not occupied by an entity.

    Args:
    x (int): The X-coordinate of the point.
    y (int): The Y-coordinate of the point.

    Returns:
    bool: False if the tile type ('t') is 1, indicating it's not an entity. True otherwise.

    Examples:
    >>> map_instance.point_collide(3, 4)
    False
    >>> map_instance.point_collide(5, 6)
    True
    """
```
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Check if two points collide on a 2D plane
point1 = (0, 0)
point2 = (3, 4)

print(point_collide(point1, point2))  # Output: True

# Edge case: Points are exactly collinear but not identical
point3 = (0.5, 1)
point4 = (1, 2)
print(point_collide(point3, point4))  # Output: False, as they are on the same line but distinct

# Advanced scenario: Checking collision between a circle and a rectangle on a 2D plane
circle_center = (5, 5)
circle_radius = 2
rectangle_corner1 = (3, 3)
rectangle_corner2 = (7, 7)

print(point_collide(circle_center, rectangle_corner1))  # Output: False, as the circle is outside the rectangle
```

    """```python
def point_collide(self, x, y):
    """
    Determines if a point (x, y) is within the map boundaries and not blocked.

    Args:
        x (int): The x-coordinate of the point.
        y (int): The y-coordinate of the point.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the point is unblocked and within bounds, False otherwise.

    Examples:
        >>> self.map = [[{'t': 0}, {'t': 1}], [{'t': 0}, {'t': 0}]]
        >>> point_collide(self, 0, 0)
