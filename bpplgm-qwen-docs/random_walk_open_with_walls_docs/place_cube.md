# place_cube

    Purpose

    The function `place_cube` creates a cube in Blender using its built-in mesh primitive add operation. The cube is positioned at the specified coordinates `(x, y)` with a size of 2 units and does not enter edit mode immediately after creation.
    Parameters

    ```python
def place_cube(x: float, y: float) -> None:
    """
    Create a cube in Blender using its built-in mesh primitive add operation.

    Parameters:
        x (float): The x-coordinate where the cube should be placed.
        y (float): The y-coordinate where the cube should be placed.

    Usage Constraints:
        - `x` and `y` must be valid float numbers representing the position of the cube's center.
        - After calling this function, you will need to manually enter edit mode if further modifications are required.
    """
```

**Examples:**
```python
place_cube(x=3.0, y=-1.5)
# This places a cube at the coordinates (3.0, -1.5) with default size 2 units.

place_cube(x=0.0, y=0.0)
# This places a cube at the origin (0.0, 0.0) with default size 2 units.
```
    Returns

    The `place_cube` function does not return any value. It directly executes operations within Blender to create a cube at the specified coordinates `(x, y)` with a size of 2 units and sets its location using `bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add`. Since it doesn't use the keyword `return`, it returns nothing.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Place a cube at coordinates (0, 0, 0) in the scene
place_cube((0, 0, 0))

# Edge case: Attempt to place a cube outside the scene bounds
place_cube((-1, -2, -3))  # This might result in an error or unexpected behavior

# Advanced scenario: Place multiple cubes in a structured grid pattern
for x in range(-5, 6):
    for y in range(-5, 6):
        place_cube((x, y, 0))
```

In the provided code:
- `place_cube` is a function that places a cube at specified coordinates in a scene.
- The basic usage demonstrates placing a single cube at the origin (0, 0, 0).
- The edge case shows attempting to place a cube outside the typical bounds of a scene, which may lead to errors or undefined behavior depending on how the code is implemented.
- The advanced scenario involves placing multiple cubes in a structured grid pattern, demonstrating the function's ability to handle arrays of coordinates.
    Docstring

    """```python
def place_cube(x, y):
    """
    Places a cube at the specified coordinates (x, y) in 3D space.

    Args:
        x (float): The x-coordinate where the cube should be placed.
        y (float): The y-coordinate where the cube should be placed.

    Returns:
        None

    Examples:
        >>> place_cube(1.0, 2.0)
        Creates a cube at (1.0, 2.0, 0) in 3D space with a size of 2.
