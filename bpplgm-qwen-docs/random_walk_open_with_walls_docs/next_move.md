# next_move

    Purpose

    This function updates the current position of a game character based on the provided movement direction. It then places a tile at the new position and adds the position to a list of visited positions.
    Parameters

    ```python
def next_move(direction):
    """
    This function updates the current position of a game character based on the provided movement direction. It then places a tile at the new position and adds the position to a list of visited positions.

    Args:
        direction (str): The direction in which the character should move, must be one of 'up', 'down', 'left', or 'right'.

    Returns:
        None

    Usage Constraints:
        - The direction parameter must be a string containing exactly one of the characters: 'u', 'd', 'l', or 'r'.
        - If the movement direction is not valid, no action will be taken and the function will return without modifying anything.

    # Assume current_position is defined elsewhere in the code
    if direction == 'up':
        new_position = (current_position[0], current_position[1] - 1)
    elif direction == 'down':
        new_position = (current_position[0], current_position[1] + 1)
    elif direction == 'left':
        new_position = (current_position[0] - 1, current_position[1])
    elif direction == 'right':
        new_position = (current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1])
    else:
        print("Invalid movement direction")
        return

    # Assume tile_placed is a function that places a tile at the given position and add_to_visited_positions is a function that adds the position to the list of visited positions
    tile_placed(new_position)
    add_to_visited_positions(new_position)

    Returns

    ```python
def next_move(movement_direction):
    """
    Update the current position of a game character based on the provided movement direction.
    Then place a tile at the new position and add the position to a list of visited positions.

    :param movement_direction: A string indicating the direction in which to move, e.g., 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right'.

    # Existing functionality is not provided in the code snippet, but assuming it updates character's position and places a tile at that position.

# Examples:
# Assuming 'next_move' updates the character's position based on the direction provided.
next_move('up')  # Updates the character's position up by one unit
next_move('left')  # Updates the character's position left by one unit
```
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Moves to the next position in a sequence
next_move = "forward 10"  # This command moves 10 units forward in the game

# Edge case: No move specified, default to moving forward by 5
next_move = ""  # If no direction is given, the AI will typically move forward by a default distance

# Advanced scenario: A series of commands to navigate through obstacles and reach a specific goal
next_move = "forward 30; turn right 90; forward 20; turn left 90; forward 15"  # This sequence moves the AI forward, turns, and continues in a zigzag pattern

    """```python
def next_move(direction):
    """
    Update the current position in the grid based on the specified direction and place a tile at that position. The position is updated by moving Y_MOVE_DISTANCE in the y-direction or X_MOVE_DISTANCE in the x-direction depending on the provided direction. The current position is then appended to the visited list. This function is used to navigate through the grid.

    Args:
        direction (str): A string indicating the direction of movement ('up', 'right', 'down', 'left').

    Returns:
        None

    Examples:
        >>> next_move('up')
        After moving up, place_tile(0, Y_MOVE_DISTANCE + y_pos) and visited.append((0, Y_MOVE_DISTANCE + y_pos))

        >>> next_move('right')
        After moving right, place_tile(X_MOVE_DISTANCE + x_pos, y_pos) and visited.append((X_MOVE_DISTANCE + x_pos, y_pos))

        >>> next_move('down')
        After moving down, place_tile(x_pos, y_pos - Y_MOVE_DISTANCE) and visited.append((x_pos, y_pos - Y_MOVE_DISTANCE))
