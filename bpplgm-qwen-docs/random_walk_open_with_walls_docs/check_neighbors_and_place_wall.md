# check_neighbors_and_place_wall

    Purpose

    The function `check_neighbors_and_place_wall` takes a position `pos` as input. It creates an offset map that contains four possible positions: two to the left and two to the right of the current position, plus two above and below it. For each offset, it checks if that position has not been visited and is not already marked as a wall. If both conditions are met, it places a cube at the offset position and adds this offset to the walls list. This function seems to be part of a larger system for generating a 3D model by recursively placing cubes and marking their positions as walls in an offset map.
    Parameters

    ```python
def check_neighbors_and_place_wall(pos):
    """
    Checks the neighbors of a given position and places a wall if valid.

    Parameters:
    pos (tuple): The current position to be checked and possibly modified in 3D space.
                 Expected to be an (x, y) tuple representing the coordinates in 2D space.

    Usage Constraints:
    - The function is part of a larger system for generating a 3D model.
    - The input `pos` should be valid within the current context of the system.

    Returns

    ### Function: `check_neighbors_and_place_wall`

#### Purpose
The function `check_neighbors_and_place_wall` takes a position `pos` as input. It creates an offset map that contains four possible positions: two to the left and two to the right of the current position, plus two above and below it. For each offset, it checks if that position has not been visited and is not already marked as a wall. If both conditions are met, it places a cube at the offset position and adds this offset to the walls list.

#### Return Value
- **Return Type**: `None`
  - The function does not return any value; it modifies the state of the global variables `offset_map`, `walls`, and `num_cubes_placed` directly.
  
- **Description**: 
  - The function places a cube at an offset position if the conditions are met. It updates the `offset_map`, `walls`, and `num_cubes_placed` to reflect these changes.

- **Special Cases**:
  - If there are no valid offsets that meet the conditions, the function does not place any cubes or update any of the global variables.
  - If multiple offsets are valid but only one is chosen for placing a cube, it places a single cube at that offset and marks it as a wall.
    Examples

    ```python
# Example 1: Basic usage
# This function checks neighboring cells and places a wall if they are unoccupied.

def check_neighbors_and_place_wall(position):
    # Check all eight possible directions for an unoccupied cell
    for dx, dy in [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]:
        new_pos = position[0] + dx, position[1] + dy
        # Place a wall at the unoccupied cell
        if game_map[new_pos[0]][new_pos[1]] == ' ':  # Check if the cell is empty
            game_map[new_pos[0]][new_pos[1]] = '#'

# Example 2: Edge case
# This function handles cases where all neighboring cells are occupied.

def check_neighbors_and_place_wall(position):
    # Flag to indicate if a wall was placed
    placed_wall = False
    for dx, dy in [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]:
        new_pos = position[0] + dx, position[1] + dy
        # Check if the cell is empty and place a wall if so
        if game_map[new_pos[0]][new_pos[1]] == ' ':  # Check if the cell is empty
            game_map[new_pos[0]][new_pos[1]] = '#'
            placed_wall = True
    # If no wall was placed, mark the position as explored
    if not placed_wall:
        game_map[position[0]][position[1]] = 'E'

# Example 3: Advanced scenario
# This function checks neighboring cells and places walls with a priority for specific types of blocks.

def check_neighbors_and_place_wall(position):
    # Check all eight possible directions for an unoccupied cell
    for dx, dy in [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]:
        new_pos = position[0] + dx, position[1] + dy
        # Check if the cell is empty and place a wall if so
        if game_map[new_pos[0]][new_pos[1]] == ' ':  # Check if the cell is empty
            # Determine which type of block to place based on conditions
            if game_map[position[0]][position[1]] == 'B':
                game_map[new_pos[0]][new_pos[1]] = '#'
                return True  # Indicate that a wall was placed
    return False  # Indicate no wall was placed
