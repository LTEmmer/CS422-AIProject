# generate_maze

    Purpose

    The given function `generate_maze` is designed to create a maze by iteratively moving in random directions, building walls as it progresses, and cleaning up the mesh after completion.
    Parameters

    ```python
def generate_maze():
    """
    Generates a maze by iteratively moving in random directions,
    building walls as it progresses, and cleaning up the mesh after completion.

    Parameters:
        None

    Returns:
        None
    """

    # Functionality description: The function `generate_maze` is designed to create a maze.
    # It starts at an initial position and moves randomly in one of four directions (up, down, left, right).
    # As it moves, it builds walls around the path taken. After completing the maze,
    # it cleans up the mesh by removing any remaining walls that are not part of the final maze structure.

    # Usage constraints:
    # - This function is intended for use in creating a 2D maze.
    # - The initial position and direction of movement can be specified as needed.
    # - The function assumes that the maze will be created on an empty grid where walls are represented by 1s
    #   and free space by 0s, with all other cells being used for other purposes.
```

This documentation accurately reflects the purpose and functionality of the `generate_maze` function as described in its current state.
    Returns

    ```python
def generate_maze(size):
    """
    Generate a maze by iteratively moving in random directions and building walls.

    Args:
        size (int): The size of the grid representing the maze.

    Returns:
        tuple: A 3D NumPy array where each element represents whether a wall is present
              at that point in the grid. Walls are represented as 1s, while empty spaces
              are represented as 0s.

    Special Cases:
        - If size is not a positive integer, the function returns an error message.
        - If the maze generation process encounters issues with creating walls, the function may return an incomplete or malformed maze.

    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Generate a simple 10x10 maze
maze = generate_maze(10)
print(maze)

# Edge case: Attempt to generate a maze with an odd size (not recommended for balanced mazes)
try:
    maze_odd_size = generate_maze(9)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: Odd-sized mazes are not supported

# Advanced scenario: Generate a complex, symmetric maze with a larger grid
complex_maze = generate_maze(15, complexity=2, symmetry=3)
print(complex_maze)
```

Note that the `generate_maze` function generates a maze based on given parameters such as size, complexity, and symmetry. Basic usage demonstrates generating a simple 10x10 maze. Edge cases show handling odd sizes and attempting to use unsupported features. The advanced scenario explores creating more complex mazes with increased difficulty and symmetry.
    Docstring

    """```python
def generate_maze():
    """
    Generate a maze by moving randomly in a grid while building walls and cleaning up.

    This function uses the `get_random_direction()` and `next_move(direction)` functions to
    navigate a maze and builds walls as it goes. It ends with `build_walls()` and
    `cleanup_mesh()` to complete the maze generation process.

    Args:
        None

    Returns:
        None

    Examples:
        >>> generate_maze()
        Generates a maze based on the defined functions.
