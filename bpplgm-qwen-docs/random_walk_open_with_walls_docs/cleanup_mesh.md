# cleanup_mesh

    Purpose

    The function `cleanup_mesh()` cleans up a set of selected 3D cubes by joining them into one, selecting all vertices in edit mode, and then removing overlapping verts to create a clean mesh.
    Parameters

    ```python
def cleanup_mesh():
    """
    Function purpose: The function `cleanup_mesh()` cleans up a set of selected 3D cubes by joining them into one, selecting all vertices in edit mode, and then removing overlapping verts to create a clean mesh.

    Examples:
        To use this function, first select the cubes you want to clean up. Then run the cleanup_mesh() function.
    """
```
    Returns

    ```python
def cleanup_mesh():
    """
    Cleans up a set of selected 3D cubes by joining them into one mesh,
    selecting all vertices in edit mode, and removing overlapping verts to create a clean mesh.

    Returns:
        None

    Special Cases:
        - If no cubes are selected or if the selection is invalid, the function does nothing.
        - If multiple cubes are selected but cannot be joined, the function joins the first two cubes found.

    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Cleans up a mesh by removing duplicate vertices and edges.

import bpy

def cleanup_mesh(mesh):
    # Remove duplicate vertices
    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='EDIT')
    bpy.ops.mesh.select_all(action='DESELECT')
    for vertex in mesh.vertices:
        if len(vertex.users) > 1:
            bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')
            bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = mesh
            bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='DESELECT')
            mesh.select_splines('all')
            bpy.ops.mesh.separate(type='ALL')
    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='EDIT')

# Edge case: Handles a mesh with no vertices or edges.

mesh_with_no_geometry = bpy.data.objects.new("NoGeometryMesh", None)
cleanup_mesh(mesh_with_no_geometry)

# Advanced scenario: Cleans up a mesh that has multiple disconnected components and invalid normals.

def remove_invalid_normals(mesh):
    # Remove invalid normals
    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='EDIT')
    for face in mesh.polygons:
        if len(face.normal) == 0 or sum(face.normal) != 1.0:
            face.normal = (1, 0, 0)  # Set to a valid normal
    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')

def cleanup_mesh_complex(mesh):
    remove_invalid_normals(mesh)
    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='EDIT')
    bpy.ops.mesh.select_all(action='DESELECT')
    for vertex in mesh.vertices:
        if len(vertex.users) > 1:
            bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')
            bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = mesh
            bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='DESELECT')
            mesh.select_splines('all')
            bpy.ops.mesh.separate(type='ALL')
    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='EDIT')

# Example usage of cleanup_mesh_complex with a complex mesh.
complex_mesh = bpy.data.meshes.new("ComplexMesh")
cleanup_mesh_complex(complex_mesh)

This docstring provides a concise description of what the function does, including its purpose. The Args and Returns sections are empty because this function has no parameters or returns, respectively. The Examples section shows how to use the function in a specific sequence, demonstrating the intended workflow described in the comments within the original code."""
