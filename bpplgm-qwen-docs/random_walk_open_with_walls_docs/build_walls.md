# build_walls

    Purpose

    The function `build_walls` iterates over a list of `visited` positions and calls the `check_neighbors_and_place_wall` function for each position, without any additional functionality. The purpose of this code is to place walls at the visited positions based on their neighbors.
    Parameters

    ### build_walls Function Documentation

```python
def build_walls(visited: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> None:
    """
    Iterates over a list of visited positions and calls the `check_neighbors_and_place_wall` function for each position.

    Parameters:
        - visited (List[Tuple[int, int]]): A list of tuples representing visited positions in the grid. Each tuple contains two integers
          corresponding to the row and column indices of a visited position.
    
    Returns:
        None: This function does not return any value; it modifies the state of the grid by placing walls at the specified positions based on their neighbors.

    Usage Constraints:
        - The `visited` list should contain tuples representing valid coordinates within the bounds of the grid. Coordinates must be non-negative integers.
        - The `check_neighbors_and_place_wall` function is expected to place a wall in the appropriate location if the condition is met for that position.
    """
```

### Examples

```python
# Example usage:
visited_positions = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]
build_walls(visited_positions)
```

This example demonstrates how to call the `build_walls` function with a list of visited positions. Each position in the `visited_positions` list should be a tuple containing valid coordinates within the grid. The function will place walls at these positions based on their neighbors, as defined by the `check_neighbors_and_place_wall` function.
    Returns

    ```python
def build_walls(visited):
    """
    Iterates over a list of visited positions and calls the check_neighbors_and_place_wall function for each position.

    :param visited: List of tuples representing the coordinates (x, y) of visited positions.
    :return: None
    """

    # Iterate over each visited position
    for pos in visited:
        # Call the check_neighbors_and_place_wall function with the current position
        check_neighbors_and_place_wall(pos)
```

**Description**: The `build_walls` function takes a list of tuples representing visited positions and iterates over each position. It then calls the `check_neighbors_and_place_wall` function for each position, without any additional functionality. This is designed to place walls at the visited positions based on their neighbors.

**Return type**: None

**Description**: The function does not return any value; it only modifies the state of the environment by calling other functions.

**Special cases**: There are no special cases in this implementation as all visited positions are processed regardless of whether they have been previously checked or placed.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Builds walls on a grid with specified dimensions and thickness.
# The function returns the grid after adding the walls.

def build_walls(grid, width, height, thickness):
    # Iterate over each row and column to add walls
    for i in range(height):
        for j in range(width):
            if i == 0 or i == height - 1:
                # Top and bottom walls
                grid[i][j] = '#'
            elif j == 0 or j == width - 1:
                # Left and right walls
                grid[i][j] = '|'

    return grid

# Example usage of the function
grid = [['.' for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(5)]
height = 5
width = 5
thickness = 1

result_grid = build_walls(grid, width, height, thickness)
for row in result_grid:
    print(''.join(row))

# Output:

# # #

```

```python
# Edge case: Building walls on a single cell grid.
# In this case, no walls are added because the grid dimensions are too small.

    if width < 2 or height < 2:
        return grid

            elif j == 0 or j == width - 1:
                grid[i][j] = '|'

    return grid

# while also adding diagonals within the walls.
