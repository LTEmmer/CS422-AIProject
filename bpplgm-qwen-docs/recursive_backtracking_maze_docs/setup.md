# setup

    Purpose

    The `setup` function initializes a 2D array of cells using the `Cell` class and sets the initial current cell to the first element in the array. It also calls the `generate_level` function to create the game level.
    Parameters

    ```python
def setup():
    """
    Initialize a 2D array of cells and set the initial current cell to the first element.

    Parameters:
        None

    Returns:
        None
    """

    # Create a 2D list of Cell objects with rows equal to ROWS and columns equal to COLS
    self.grid = [[Cell() for _ in range(COLS)] for _ in range(ROWS)]

    # Set the current cell to the first element in the grid
    self.current_cell = self.grid[0][0]

    # Generate the game level based on the grid configuration
    generate_level(self.grid)
```
    Returns

    ```python
def setup():
    """
    Initializes a 2D array of cells using the Cell class and sets the initial current cell to the first element in the array. It also calls the generate_level function to create the game level.

    Returns:
        - The initialized grid: A 2D list of Cell objects representing the game board.
    """

    # Initialize a 2D array of cells
    grid = [[Cell() for _ in range(8)] for _ in range(10)]

    # Set the initial current cell to the first element in the grid
    current_cell = grid[0][0]

    # Generate the level
    generate_level(grid, current_cell)

    return grid
```
    Examples

    ### Basic Usage

```python
# Initializes a setup object with default parameters.
setup_obj = Setup()
```

### Edge Case

```python
# Initializes a setup object with custom parameters. In this case, specifying a non-existent directory.
setup_obj = Setup(directory="/path/to/non/existent/directory")
```

### Advanced Scenario

```python
# Initializes a setup object with specified number of threads and directories for different tasks.
setup_obj = Setup(num_threads=4, data_dir="/data/dir", config_file="/config/config.json")
```
    Docstring

    """```python
def setup():
    """
    Sets up the game environment by creating a 2D array of cells and initializing the current cell.

    Args:
        rows (int): The number of rows in the grid.
        cols (int): The number of columns in the grid.
    
    Returns:
        None

    Examples:
        setup(10, 10)
        This will create a 10x10 grid of cells and set the current cell to the first cell in the array.

    global current_cell

            cell_array.append(cell)
