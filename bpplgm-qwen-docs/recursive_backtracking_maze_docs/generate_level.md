# generate_level

    Purpose

    The function `generate_level` generates a maze using the depth-first search algorithm. It starts from a given starting point, explores all neighboring cells recursively until it reaches the end of the level or cannot move further without revisiting any cell. The maze is created by modifying the mesh and adding new vertices as the level progresses.
    Parameters

    ```python
def generate_level(start_point: Tuple[int, int], end_point: Tuple[int, int], mesh: Mesh) -> None:
    """
    Generate a maze using the depth-first search algorithm.

    Parameters:
        start_point (Tuple[int, int]): The starting position for generating the maze.
        end_point (Tuple[int, int]): The ending position for the maze.
        mesh (Mesh): The 3D mesh object to modify and add vertices.

    Returns:
        None: This function modifies the mesh in place without returning any value.
    """
```

The `generate_level` function takes three parameters:

1. **start_point**: A tuple of two integers representing the starting position for generating the maze. This is where the algorithm will begin its exploration.

2. **end_point**: A tuple of two integers representing the ending position for the maze. This is the goal that the algorithm aims to reach during its search.

3. **mesh**: An instance of a `Mesh` class, which is used to represent and manipulate 3D structures such as walls or floor plans. The function modifies this mesh by adding vertices and connecting them with edges to form the maze path.

The function does not return any value but modifies the input `mesh` in place to create the maze structure.
    Returns

    The `generate_level` function does not return a value. It modifies the mesh in place to create a maze by exploring neighboring cells recursively until it reaches the end of the level or cannot move further without revisiting any cell. The maze is built by adding new vertices and edges to the mesh as the algorithm progresses.

Special cases:
- If the starting point is invalid or unreachable, the function may enter an infinite loop attempting to explore cells.
- If no valid path exists from the start to the end of the level, the function will likely not terminate correctly.
- The specific behavior of the function may vary depending on the implementation and the parameters passed to it.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Generates a level with default parameters (6 x 4 grid)
level = generate_level()

# The generated level will be a 2D list representing a game board
print(level)

# Edge case: Generates a very small level (1 x 1 grid)
small_level = generate_level(1, 1)

# The generated level will be a single cell, representing a 1x1 grid
print(small_level)

# Advanced scenario: Generates a large level (20 x 15 grid) with obstacles
large_obstacles = [(i, j) for i in range(20) for j in range(15)]
level_with_obstacles = generate_level(20, 15, obstacles=large_obstacles)

# The generated level will be a 2D list representing a larger grid with specified obstacles
print(level_with_obstacles)
```

    """```python
def generate_level():
    # Determines the state of the maze generation process and handles cell movement to create a maze structure.

A one-line description: 
Generates a maze by exploring and connecting unvisited cells until all cells are visited, building a connected path from start to finish.

Args:
    None

Returns:
    A generated maze represented as a set of interconnected cells.

Examples:
>>> generate_level()
# Example output showing the generation process would depend on specific cell movements.
