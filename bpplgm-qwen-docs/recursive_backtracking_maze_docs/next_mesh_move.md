# next_mesh_move

    Purpose

    This function selects and moves the face that is next to the current position in a specified direction within a mesh, then performs an extrusion based on predefined distances and appends the direction to a stack.
    Parameters

    ```python
def next_mesh_move(mesh, direction):
    """
    Selects and moves the face that is next to the current position in a specified direction within a mesh, then performs an extrusion based on predefined distances.

    Parameters:
        mesh (Mesh): The 3D model or mesh to be manipulated.
        direction (str): The direction in which to select the face. Expected values are 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right', and 'front'/'back'. Directions for front/back must include a suffix ('f' or 'b').

    Returns:
        None: This function does not return any value.
    """
    # Example usage
    next_mesh_move(my_mesh, "up")  # Moves the face directly above the current position
    next_mesh_move(my_mesh, "rightf")  # Moves and extrudes the face to the right front of the current position
```

**Explanation**: The `next_mesh_move` function selects a face adjacent to the current position in a specified direction within a mesh. It then performs an extrusion based on predefined distances in that direction. The `direction` parameter specifies the movement, which can be one of several pre-defined strings indicating up, down, left, right, front, or back movements.
    Returns

    This function does not have any explicit return statements. It modifies the mesh by moving a face in a specified direction and then extruding it based on predefined distances. The direction is appended to a stack.

Return type: None

Description: This function performs an action that updates the mesh by moving a face and performing an extrusion, but does not return any specific value. The result of this operation is applied directly to the mesh without any return statement indicating success or failure. Special cases: The function assumes certain conditions about the input mesh and its current state (e.g., faces are adjacent in the specified direction) that may lead to unexpected behavior if these assumptions are not met.

Examples:
```python
# Assuming next_mesh_move is part of a larger script for editing a 3D model
next_mesh_move(mesh, 'right', [0.5, 1.0], 'extrude')
```
In this example, the `next_mesh_move` function moves the face adjacent to the current position in the mesh to the right by 0.5 units along the x-axis and then extrudes it by 1.0 unit along the z-axis. The direction 'right' is appended to a stack that tracks movements for later operations.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Returns the next move in a mesh simulation given current state and constraints
def basic_usage():
    # Assuming 'mesh' is an instance of MeshSimulation with a method 'next_move'
    mesh = MeshSimulation()
    move_result = mesh.next_move(current_state, constraints)
    return move_result

# Edge case: Handles situations where the next move cannot be determined (e.g., invalid state)
def edge_case():
    # Assuming 'mesh' is an instance of MeshSimulation with a method 'next_move'
    mesh = MeshSimulation()
    try:
        move_result = mesh.next_move(invalid_state, constraints)
        return move_result
    except NoMoveAvailableError as e:
        print(f"Edge case: {e}")

# Advanced scenario: Uses the next_mesh_move to simulate multiple turns in a game
def advanced_scenario():
    # Assuming 'mesh' is an instance of MeshSimulation with methods 'next_move' and 'play_turn'
    mesh = MeshSimulation()
    for _ in range(number_of_turns):
        move_result = mesh.next_move(current_state, constraints)
        mesh.play_turn(move_result)
```

Each example provides a basic demonstration of the `next_mesh_move` function within a specific context.
    Docstring

    """```python
def next_mesh_move(direction):
    """
    Move to the face in the mesh that is adjacent to the current position based on the given direction.

    Args:
        direction (str): The direction to move ('up', 'right', 'down', 'left').

    Returns:
        None

    Examples:
        >>> mesh.faces = [Face(...), Face(...)]
        >>> next_mesh_move('up')
        Move to the face with normal.y == 1.0, at y_pos - y_move_distance, and x_pos - 1.
        >>> next_mesh_move('right')
        Move to the face with normal.x == 1.0, at y_pos - 1, and x_pos + x_move_distance.
