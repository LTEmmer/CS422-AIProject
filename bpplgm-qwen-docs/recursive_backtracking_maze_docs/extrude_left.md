# extrude_left

    Purpose

    The function `extrude_left` calls the `extrude` function with arguments `-x_move_distance`, `0`, and `0`. This function likely performs a leftward extrusion or movement in a three-dimensional space.
    Parameters

    ```python
def extrude_left(x_move_distance):
    """
    Perform a leftward extrusion or movement in three-dimensional space.

    Args:
        x_move_distance (float): The distance to move along the x-axis to perform the extrusion. Positive values move right, negative values move left.

    Returns:
        None

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `x_move_distance` is not a valid number.

    Example usage:
    >>> extrude_left(5)
    # Performs a leftward extrusion of 5 units along the x-axis
    """
    if not isinstance(x_move_distance, (int, float)):
        raise ValueError("x_move_distance must be a number")

    # Call the extrude function with specific arguments for leftward movement
    extrude(-x_move_distance, 0, 0)
```

In this example, the `extrude_left` function is documented to perform a leftward extrusion in three-dimensional space. The parameter `x_move_distance` specifies how far to move along the x-axis. The function checks if the input is a valid number and then calls the `extrude` function with arguments that correspond to moving left.
    Returns

    ```python
def extrude_left(x_move_distance):
    """
    Moves an object leftward by `x_move_distance` units in a three-dimensional space.

    Args:
        x_move_distance (float): The distance to move the object leftwards along the X-axis.

    Returns:
        None: This function does not return any value. It performs the extrusion operation directly.
    
    Special Cases:
        - If `x_move_distance` is zero, no movement occurs.
        - If `x_move_distance` is negative, the movement is performed in the opposite direction of the positive X-axis (rightwards).
    """
    # Perform the leftward extrusion by calling the 'extrude' function with specified arguments
    extrude(-x_move_distance, 0, 0)
```

This documentation provides a clear explanation of what the `extrude_left` function does, its parameters, and any special cases it may handle. It also includes the return type (None) as stated in the original code comments.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Extrude a rectangle leftward by 5 units
rectangle = (0, 0, 10, 20)  # Coordinates: bottom-left and top-right corners
extruded_rectangle = extrude_left(rectangle, 5)
print("Extruded Rectangle:", extruded_rectangle)

# Edge case: Extruding a rectangle beyond its bounds
rectangle_beyond_bounds = (-30, -40, 10, 20)  # Coordinates outside the typical screen area
extruded_rectangle_beyond_bounds = extrude_left(rectangle_beyond_bounds, 5)
print("Extruded Rectangle Beyond Bounds:", extruded_rectangle_beyond_bounds)

# Advanced scenario: Extruding a rectangle by different amounts on each axis
advanced_rectangle = (0, 0, 10, 20)  # Coordinates of the rectangle
extrude_left_advanced = extrude_left(advanced_rectangle, 3, 7)
print("Extruded Rectangle with Different Amounts:", extrude_left_advanced)
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to use the `extrude_left` function, which takes a rectangle's coordinates and an amount to extrude it leftward. It includes basic usage, handling edge cases where the extrusion extends beyond typical screen boundaries, and shows how to apply different amounts of extrusion on each axis.
    Docstring

    """```python
def extrude_left():
    """Extrudes a distance to the left.

    Args:
        - x_move_distance (float): The amount to move to the left during extrusion.

    Returns:
        None

    Examples:
        >>> extrude_left(5)
        Move -5 units in the x-direction.
        
        >>> extrude_left(-3)
        Move 3 units in the negative x-direction.
