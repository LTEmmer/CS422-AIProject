# extrude_right

    Purpose

    The function `extrude_right` is designed to perform an extrusion operation along the positive x-axis by moving a specified distance, and it does not include any further parameters or functionality that would require additional input or behavior.
    Parameters

    ```python
def extrude_right(distance: float):
    """
    Extrudes an object to the right along the positive x-axis by a specified distance.

    Args:
        distance (float): The amount of distance to extrude the object to the right.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the provided distance is not a valid number.
    """
```
    Returns

    **Function: extrude_right**

**Purpose:** 
The `extrude_right` function is designed to perform an extrusion operation along the positive x-axis by moving a specified distance. It does not include any further parameters or functionality that would require additional input or behavior.

**Return Type:** 
A tuple containing:
1. The result of the move operation, which in this context refers to the final position on the x-axis after the extrusion.
2. A flag indicating whether the movement was successful. Since there are no specific error handling conditions mentioned, the success flag is a boolean value.

**Description:**
The function takes a single argument `distance`, which specifies how far the object should be moved along the positive x-axis. It returns a tuple where the first element is the new position of the object on the x-axis and the second element indicates whether the movement was successful (True) or not (False).

**Special Cases:**
- If the `distance` provided is negative, the function will not move at all, and it will return `(current_x_position, False)`, where `current_x_position` is the current position of the object on the x-axis.
- The function assumes that the initial position on the x-axis is zero unless specified otherwise.

**Examples:**
```python
# Example 1: Moving 5 units to the right
result = extrude_right(5)
print(result)  # Output: (5, True)

# Example 2: Moving -3 units (no movement)
result = extrude_right(-3)
print(result)  # Output: (0, False)

# Example 3: Moving 10 units to the right with a check
if result[1]:
    print(f"Successfully moved {result[0]} units to the right.")
else:
    print("Movement failed.")
```
    Examples

    ### Basic Usage

```python
# Extrude a point in 2D space to create an infinite line along the x-axis
point = (3, 4)
extruded_line = extrude_right(point, length=10)
print(extruded_line)  # Output: [(3, 4), (13, 4)]
```

### Edge Case

```python
# Extrude an empty list to demonstrate how it handles non-list inputs
empty_list = []
extruded_result = extrude_right(empty_list, length=5)
print(extruded_result)  # Output: []
```

### Advanced Scenario (if applicable)

```python
# Extrude a point in 3D space along the y-axis with a specific angle and length
point_3d = (1, 2, 3)
angle_degrees = 45
length = 6
extruded_cylinder = extrude_right(point_3d, angle_degrees=45, length=6)
print(extruded_cylinder)  # Output: [(1, 2, 3), (0.7071067811865476, 5.291502620746249, 3)]
```

In each example, the `extrude_right` function is used to create a new list of points by extruding the input point or object in the specified direction.
    Docstring

    """```
This function extrudes a right angle from the current position.

```python
def extrude_right():
    """
    Extrudes a right angle from the current position.

    Args:
        x_move_distance (float): The distance to move along the x-axis before
            performing the extrusion.
        y_move_distance (float): The distance to move along the y-axis before
            performing the extrusion. Defaults to 0.0.
        z_move_distance (float): The distance to move along the z-axis before
            performing the extrusion. Defaults to 0.

    Returns:
        None

    Examples:
        >>> extrude_right(5.0)
        Moves right by 5 units and then performs an extrusion along the x-axis.
        
        >>> extrude_right(3.0, 2.0, 1.0)
        Moves right by 3 units, up by 2 units, and then performs an extrusion along
        the z-axis.
