# add_inner_walls

    Purpose

    This function recursively adds walls to a level map by dividing the room into smaller sections and building walls that divide these sections. It stops when the room size is less than a specified minimum size (MIN_SIZE). If the width of the room is greater than its height, it builds vertical walls; otherwise, horizontal walls. The wall is randomly placed within each section to ensure uniformity in the layout.
    Parameters

    ```python
def add_inner_walls(level_map, rmin, cmin, rmax, cmax):
    """
    Recursively adds walls to a level map by dividing the room into smaller sections and building walls that divide these sections.

    Args:
        level_map (list of lists): The 2D list representing the level map where walls will be added.
        rmin (int): The minimum row index of the current section.
        cmin (int): The minimum column index of the current section.
        rmax (int): The maximum row index of the current section.
        cmax (int): The maximum column index of the current section.

    Returns:
        None: Modifies the level_map in place to add walls.

    Purpose:
        This function divides the room into smaller sections and builds walls that divide these sections. It continues until the size of
        the room is less than a specified minimum size (MIN_SIZE). If the width of the room is greater than its height, it builds
        vertical walls; otherwise, horizontal walls. The wall is randomly placed within each section to ensure uniformity in the layout.

    Usage Constraints:
        - level_map must be a non-empty 2D list.
        - All indices (rmin, cmin, rmax, cmax) must be valid and within bounds of the level_map dimensions.
        - MIN_SIZE should be an integer greater than 0 to define the minimum size for stopping recursion.

    Examples:
        >>> level_map = [[0] * 10 for _ in range(10)]
        >>> add_inner_walls(level_map, 1, 2, 8, 9)
        # The level_map will have walls added inside the specified section
    """
```
    Returns

    ```python
def add_inner_walls(level_map: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Recursively adds walls to a level map by dividing rooms into smaller sections and building walls that divide these sections.
    
    The function stops when the room size is less than MIN_SIZE. If the width of the room is greater than its height, vertical
    walls are built; otherwise, horizontal walls. The wall is randomly placed within each section to ensure uniformity in the layout.

    Returns:
        level_map: A modified level map with added inner walls.
        
    Special Cases:
        - If MIN_SIZE is set to 0, no walls will be added.
        - If the room size after division becomes less than or equal to MIN_SIZE, the function stops further recursion and returns the level map as is.

    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Adding inner walls to a room definition in a building model.

class Room:
    def __init__(self):
        self.walls = []

    def add_inner_walls(self, wall_dimensions):
        # Add multiple inner walls based on provided dimensions.
        for dimension in wall_dimensions:
            self.walls.append(dimension)

# Example usage
room = Room()
room.add_inner_walls([(2.5, 3), (4.5, 3)])
print(room.walls)  # Output: [(2.5, 3), (4.5, 3)]
```

```python
# Edge case: Adding no walls to a room definition.

class Room:
    def __init__(self):
        self.walls = []

    def add_inner_walls(self, wall_dimensions):
        # Add multiple inner walls based on provided dimensions.
        for dimension in wall_dimensions:
            self.walls.append(dimension)

# Example usage
room = Room()
room.add_inner_walls([])  # Adding an empty list of wall dimensions.
print(room.walls)  # Output: []
```

```python
# Advanced scenario: Adding multiple inner walls with different configurations.

class Room:
    def __init__(self):
        self.walls = []

    def add_inner_walls(self, wall_dimensions):
        # Add multiple inner walls based on provided dimensions.
        for dimension in wall_dimensions:
            self.walls.append(dimension)

# Example usage
room = Room()
room.add_inner_walls([(2.5, 3), (4.5, 3), (1.5, 2)])
print(room.walls)  # Output: [(2.5, 3), (4.5, 3), (1.5, 2)]
```

Each example demonstrates how to use the `add_inner_walls` method in a Room class, showcasing basic functionality, handling edge cases, and advanced scenarios as described.

print(level_map)
# Output will be a level map with inner walls added, but the specific pattern depends on the random_number function
```
Note: The `random_number` function is assumed to be defined elsewhere and takes two arguments, returning a random number within that range."""
