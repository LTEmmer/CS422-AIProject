# add_cubes

    Purpose

    The function `add_cubes` takes a level map as input and uses Blender's scripting to add cubes at positions in the map where the value is 0. Each cube has a size of 2 units and is positioned such that its base aligns with the grid defined by the `level_map`.
    Parameters

    ```python
def add_cubes(level_map):
    """
    Adds cubes to a Blender scene based on the provided level map.

    Parameters:
    level_map (list of list of int): A 2D grid where each element represents the height at that position.
                                   A value of 0 indicates that a cube should be added at that location.

    Returns:
    None

    Usage Constraints:
    - The `level_map` must be a square grid, with the same number of rows and columns.
    - Each cell in the grid can only contain an integer value.
    """
```
    Returns

    ```python
def add_cubes(level_map):
    """
    Adds cubes to a Blender scene based on the values in the provided level map.

    Parameters:
    level_map (list of list of int): A 2D grid where each element represents whether a cube should be placed at that position.
                                   If the value is 0, a cube will be added; otherwise, no cube will be placed.

    Returns:
    int: The number of cubes successfully added to the scene.

    Special Cases:
    - If the level_map is empty or contains only zeros, no cubes are added and the function returns 0.
    """
    # Calculate the total number of cubes that need to be added
    total_cubes = sum(sum(row) for row in level_map)
    
    if total_cubes == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Function to add a cube at a given position
    def add_cube(x, y):
        bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=2, location=(x * 2, -y * 2, 0))
    
    # Loop through the level map and place cubes where values are 0
    for x, row in enumerate(level_map):
        for y, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == 0:
                add_cube(x, y)
    
    return total_cubes

# Example usage
level_map = [
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0]
]

print(add_cubes(level_map))  # Output: 4
```

In this function:
- The `add_cubes` function takes a 2D list `level_map` as input.
- It calculates the total number of cubes to be added based on non-zero values in the map.
- If no cubes are needed, it returns 0 immediately.
- The function defines an inner function `add_cube` to add cubes using Blender's mesh operations.
- It iterates over the level map and calls `add_cube` at each position where the value is 0.
- Finally, it returns the total number of cubes successfully added.
    Examples

    ```python
# Example 1: Basic usage
# Adds the cubes of three numbers: 2, 3, and 4.
print(add_cubes(2, 3, 4))  # Output should be 99

# Explanation: The function `add_cubes` calculates the sum of the cubes of the provided numbers.
# It takes three arguments (2, 3, 4) and returns their cube sums: (2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3).
```

```python
# Example 2: Edge case
# Adds the cube of a single number: 0.
print(add_cubes(0))  # Output should be 0

# Explanation: The function `add_cubes` handles edge cases where only one number is provided.
# When given an input of 0, it correctly returns 0^3, which is 0.
```

```python
# Example 3: Advanced scenario (if applicable)
# Adds the cubes of a list of numbers: [1, 2, 3].
print(add_cubes(1, 2, 3))  # Output should be 36

# Explanation: The function `add_cubes` can also accept a list of numbers. In this case,
# it calculates the sum of the cubes of each number in the list: (1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3).
```

```

This function takes a 2D list `level_map` as input and places cubes in Blender's 3D space based on the values in the map. A cube is placed for each cell with a value of 0, starting from the origin (x=0, y=0) and incrementing both x and y by 2 after placing a cube. The function modifies the scene in-place to add cubes according to the specified layout."""
