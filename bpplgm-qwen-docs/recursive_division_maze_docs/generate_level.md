# generate_level

    Purpose

    This function initializes a new level by clearing the existing scene, creating a 2D grid (map), adding walls to the edges and inner spaces of the grid, populating the map with cubes based on the grid, and finally cleaning up the mesh to remove internal faces.
    Parameters

    ```python
def generate_level(size):
    """
    Initialize a new level by clearing the existing scene, creating a 2D grid (map),
    adding walls to the edges and inner spaces of the grid, populating the map with cubes based on the grid,
    and finally cleaning up the mesh to remove internal faces.

    Parameters:
        size (int): The size of the level's grid. Determines the width and height of the grid.
                      This parameter is mandatory and must be provided when calling the function.

    Usage Constraints:
        - size must be a positive integer representing the dimensions of the grid.
        - The function requires an existing scene to work, so ensure the scene is initialized before calling this function.
    """
```
    Returns

    ```python
def generate_level():
    """
    Initializes a new level by clearing the existing scene, creating a 2D grid (map),
    adding walls to the edges and inner spaces of the grid, populating the map with cubes based on the grid,
    and finally cleaning up the mesh to remove internal faces.

    Returns:
        None

    Special cases:
        - If the level cannot be generated due to resource limitations or errors in processing,
          an error message will be printed but no level will be created.
    """
```

This function initializes a new level by clearing any existing scene, creating a 2D grid (map), adding walls to the edges and inner spaces of the map, populating the map with cubes based on the grid, and finally cleaning up the mesh to remove internal faces. The function returns `None` as it does not return any specific value, but rather performs side effects such as modifying the scene in a game engine or graphics library that supports 3D rendering and procedural generation.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Generate a level with default parameters.
level = generate_level()
print(level)

# Edge case: Try generating a level with an invalid number of enemies.
try:
    generate_level(num_enemies=100)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Output will be "Invalid number of enemies"

# Advanced scenario: Generate a level where players can move diagonally and collect items.
level = generate_level(movement_type='diagonal', item_persistence=True)
print(level)
```

    Args:
