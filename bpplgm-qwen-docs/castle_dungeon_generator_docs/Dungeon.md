# Dungeon

    Purpose

    The `Dungeon` class generates a dungeon layout by creating rooms and connecting them together within a specified grid size. It uses random generation to place rooms and connects them randomly until all rooms are connected. The generated layout is then rendered as a series of cubes using Blender's mesh operations.
    Docstring

    """```python
class Dungeon:
    """
    Generates a random dungeon layout with rooms and connections using Blender's mesh.primitive_cube_add function to place cubes.

    Attributes:
        x_size (int): The width of the dungeon grid in units.
        y_size (int): The height of the dungeon grid in units.
        min_room_size (int): The minimum size of a room in units.
        max_room_size (int): The maximum size of a room in units.
        min_rooms (int): The minimum number of rooms to generate.
        max_rooms (int): The maximum number of rooms to generate.
        num_rooms (int): The total number of rooms generated.
        map (list of lists of dict): A 2D grid representing the dungeon layout, where each cell is a dictionary containing room-related information.
        rooms (list of dict): A list of dictionaries, each representing a room with its position and size.
        connected (list of dict): A list of dictionaries, each representing a connected room.
