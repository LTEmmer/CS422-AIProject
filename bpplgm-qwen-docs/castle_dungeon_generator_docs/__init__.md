# __init__

    Purpose

    This function initializes a new instance of a game environment with specific parameters for room sizes and number of rooms. The `x_size` and `y_size` variables define the dimensions of the map, while `min_room_size` and `max_room_size` specify the range of possible room sizes. `min_rooms` and `max_rooms` set the lower and upper bounds on the number of rooms to be generated. The remaining attributes are initialized as `None` to hold their values during game setup.
    Parameters

    ```python
def __init__(self, x_size: int, y_size: int, min_room_size: int, max_room_size: int, min_rooms: int, max_rooms: int):
    """
    Initialize a new instance of a game environment.

    Parameters:
        self (object): The instance being initialized.
        x_size (int): The width of the map (number of columns).
        y_size (int): The height of the map (number of rows).
        min_room_size (int): The minimum size allowed for any room in terms of number of tiles.
        max_room_size (int): The maximum size allowed for any room in terms of number of tiles.
        min_rooms (int): The lower bound on the number of rooms to be generated.
        max_rooms (int): The upper bound on the number of rooms to be generated.

    Attributes:
        self.map (List[List[int]]): A 2D list representing the game map, initialized as None.
        self.rooms: A list of tuples containing the positions and sizes of all rooms in the map. Initialized as None.
        self.player_position (Tuple[int, int]): The current position of the player in the map. Initialized as None.
    """
```

This function initializes a new instance of a game environment with specific parameters for room sizes and number of rooms. It sets up variables to define the dimensions of the map (`x_size` and `y_size`) and specifies the range of possible room sizes (`min_room_size` and `max_room_size`). It also defines the lower and upper bounds on the number of rooms to be generated (`min_rooms` and `max_rooms`). The remaining attributes are initialized as `None` to hold their values during game setup.
    Returns

    The `__init__` function initializes a new instance of a game environment with specified dimensions and constraints for room creation. The parameters are:
- `x_size`: The width of the map in tiles.
- `y_size`: The height of the map in tiles.
- `min_room_size`: The minimum size of any room that can be generated, measured in tiles.
- `max_room_size`: The maximum size of any room that can be generated, measured in tiles.
- `min_rooms`: The lower bound on the number of rooms to generate.
- `max_rooms`: The upper bound on the number of rooms to generate.

The function initializes several attributes:
- `self.room_sizes`: A list of room sizes to be used when generating rooms. This is calculated based on the `min_room_size`, `max_room_size`, and the desired average room size derived from the bounds.
- `self.num_rooms`: The total number of rooms to generate, chosen randomly between `min_rooms` and `max_rooms`.
- `self.room_count`: A counter for tracking how many rooms have been created so far.

The function does not return a value explicitly; it initializes attributes of the class instance. Special cases include if any of the input parameters are out of valid ranges (e.g., negative sizes or invalid room bounds), which would result in an error during object initialization.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Creating an instance with default parameters
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.default_value = 0

obj1 = MyClass()
print(obj1.default_value)  # Output: 0

# Edge case: Using a custom value during initialization
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.custom_value = value

obj2 = MyClass(42)
print(obj2.custom_value)  # Output: 42

# Advanced scenario: Initializing with multiple parameters and using them in methods
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value1, value2):
        self.value1 = value1
        self.value2 = value2

    def calculate_sum(self):
        return self.value1 + self.value2

obj3 = MyClass(5, 7)
print(obj3.calculate_sum())  # Output: 12
