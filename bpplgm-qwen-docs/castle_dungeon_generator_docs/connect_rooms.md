# connect_rooms

    Purpose

    This function connects two rooms by finding a path between them using random coordinates and then marking the map cells along that path as walkable. If specified, it marks both rooms as connected. The function uses nested loops to move from one room's edge to the other's edge while ensuring no overlap in their connection paths.
    Parameters

    ```python
def connect_rooms(self, room, closest_room, should_connect=False):
    """
    This function connects two rooms by finding a path between them using random coordinates and then marking the map cells along that path as walkable. If specified, it marks both rooms as connected.

    Args:
        self: The instance of the class (used for accessing methods and attributes).
        room: A dictionary representing the first room in the connection.
        closest_room: A dictionary representing the second room in the connection.
        should_connect: An optional boolean parameter indicating whether to mark the rooms as connected after connecting them. Defaults to False.

    Usage Constraints:
        - Ensure that both 'room' and 'closest_room' dictionaries contain 'coordinates', 'width', and 'height' keys.
        - The function assumes a square grid map where each cell is represented by its x and y coordinates in the 'coordinates' list.

    Returns

    ```python
def connect_rooms(map_width: int, map_height: int, start_x: int, start_y: int, end_x: int, end_y: int) -> bool:
    """
    Connects two rooms by finding a path between them using random coordinates and marking the map cells along that path as walkable.
    
    Parameters:
    - map_width (int): The width of the map grid.
    - map_height (int): The height of the map grid.
    - start_x (int): The starting x-coordinate of one room's edge.
    - start_y (int): The starting y-coordinate of one room's edge.
    - end_x (int): The ending x-coordinate of another room's edge.
    - end_y (int): The ending y-coordinate of another room's edge.

    Returns:
    - bool: True if the rooms are successfully connected, False otherwise.
    
    Special Cases:
    - If either start or end coordinates exceed the map dimensions, returns False.
    - If the path between the two rooms is not found, returns False.

    # Implementation details would be provided in the actual code
```

**Explanation:**
- The `connect_rooms` function connects two rooms by finding a path between them using random coordinates and marking the map cells along that path as walkable.
- It takes six parameters: `map_width`, `map_height`, `start_x`, `start_y`, `end_x`, and `end_y`.
- The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the rooms were successfully connected or not.
- Special cases include:
  - If either `start` or `end` coordinates exceed the map dimensions, the function returns False.
  - If no path between the two rooms is found, the function also returns False.

**Examples:**
```python
# Example usage of connect_rooms
map_width = 10
map_height = 10
room1_start_x = 3
room1_start_y = 4
room2_end_x = 7
room2_end_y = 6

result = connect_rooms(map_width, map_height, room1_start_x, room1_start_y, room2_end_x, room2_end_y)
print(result)  # Output: True or False based on successful connection
```
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Connect two rooms in a dictionary-based system
rooms = {
    "Living Room": {"North": None},
    "Kitchen": {"South": None}
}

connect_rooms(rooms, ("Living Room", "Kitchen"), ("North", "South"))

print(rooms)
```
This code connects the Living Room to the Kitchen using the `connect_rooms` function. It specifies the direction of connection and updates the room dictionary accordingly.

```python
# Edge case: Attempting to connect a non-existent room
rooms = {
    "Living Room": {"North": None},
    "Kitchen": {"South": None}
}

try:
    connect_rooms(rooms, ("Garage", "Living Room"), ("West", "East"))
except KeyError as e:
    print(e)

print(rooms)
```
This example demonstrates how the function handles an attempt to connect a non-existent room. It catches the `KeyError` and prints an error message.

```python
# Advanced scenario: Connecting multiple rooms and handling existing connections
rooms = {
    "Living Room": {"North": None},
    "Kitchen": {"South": None}
}

connect_rooms(rooms, ("Living Room", "Kitchen"), ("North", "South"))
connect_rooms(rooms, ("Kitchen", "Bathroom"), ("East", "West"))

print(rooms)
```
This advanced scenario shows how the `connect_rooms` function can be used to connect multiple rooms and handle existing connections by ensuring that no room is connected in two different directions.
