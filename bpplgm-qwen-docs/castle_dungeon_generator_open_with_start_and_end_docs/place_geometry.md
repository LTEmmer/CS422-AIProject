# place_geometry

    Purpose

    This function `place_geometry` is designed to render a 3D geometric representation of a maze based on its internal map structure. It uses Blender's BMesh operations to create cubes (walls), spheres (start), cylinders (end), and planes (floor tiles) according to the values in the maze map, which specifies different types of entities at each coordinate in the grid.
    Parameters

    ```python
def place_geometry(self):
    """

    Parameters:
    - self: The instance of the class that this function belongs to. It is assumed to have a `maze_map` attribute containing the maze data.
    """
```

```python
# Example usage:

class MazeRenderer:
    def __init__(self, maze_map):
        self.maze_map = maze_map

def main():
    maze_map = [
        [0, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 0],
        [1, 0, 0]
    ]
    
    renderer = MazeRenderer(maze_map)
    renderer.place_geometry()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this example, the `MazeRenderer` class has an `__init__` method that initializes with a `maze_map`. The `place_geometry` method is called on an instance of `MazeRenderer` to render the maze according to the specified structure.
    Returns

    ```python
def place_geometry(maze_map):
    """
    This function renders a 3D geometric representation of a maze based on its internal map structure.

    Args:
        maze_map (list of lists): A 2D list representing the maze grid, where each cell contains an integer
                                corresponding to different types of entities: 1 for walls, 0 for floor tiles,
                                2 for start points, and 3 for end points.

    Returns:
        None

    The function uses Blender's BMesh operations to create cubes (walls), spheres (start),
    cylinders (end), and planes (floor tiles) based on the values in the maze map. Each entity
    type corresponds to a specific Blender primitive created by the function.

    Special Cases:
        - If any cell contains an invalid type of entity, a warning message is printed.
        - The function does not return any value; it modifies the scene directly using Blender's BMesh API.

    Examples

    ### Basic Usage

This example demonstrates how to use `place_geometry` with a simple shape, such as a circle. The function requires a dictionary with coordinates and radius.

```python
# Explanation: Demonstrates basic usage of place_geometry for placing a circle.
import json
from shapely.geometry import Point, Polygon

geometry = {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [0, 0]
}

place_geometry(geometry)
```

### Edge Case

This example shows how `place_geometry` handles edge cases where the provided geometry is invalid. It attempts to place a geometry with an unsupported type.

```python
# Explanation: Demonstrates handling of an invalid geometry.
invalid_geometry = {
    "type": "LineString",
    "coordinates": [[0, 0], [1, 1]]
}

try:
    place_geometry(invalid_geometry)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Expected output: Unsupported geometry type
```

### Advanced Scenario

This example showcases how `place_geometry` can be used in conjunction with additional parameters for more complex placements. It specifies the placement area and layer.

```python
# Explanation: Demonstrates an advanced scenario using place_geometry.
placement_area = Polygon([(0, 0), (5, 0), (5, 5), (0, 5)])
layer = "boundary"

place_geometry(geometry, bounds=placement_area, layer=layer)
```

Note that the actual implementation of `place_geometry` would depend on the broader context and additional libraries used in the code.
    Docstring

    """```python
def place_geometry(self):
    """
    This function iterates through the self.map array and creates 3D objects based on the type values ('t') in each element.
    - '0' and '1' are not used for maze body and hence, they are skipped.
    - '2' represents walls, creating a cube at their position with a size of 2 units.
    - '3' represents the beginning point, creating an UV sphere with a radius of 1 unit.
    - '4' represents the end point, creating a cylinder with a radius of 1 unit.
    - Any other value creates a floor tile using a plane with a size of 2 units.

    Args:
        None

    Returns:
        None

    Examples:
        # Assuming self.map is an array defined elsewhere
        self.place_geometry()
        
        This will iterate through the map and create various 3D objects based on the type values in each element.
