# point_collide

    Purpose

    The function `point_collide` checks if a specific position on the map is blocked. It returns `False` if the position has a block (`'t'` attribute equal to 1), indicating that it cannot be occupied or passed through, and `True` otherwise.
    Parameters

    ```python
def point_collide(self, x: int, y: int) -> bool:
    """
    Check if a specific position on the map is blocked.

    Parameters:
        self (TileMap): The instance of TileMap to be checked.
        x (int): The x-coordinate of the position to check.
        y (int): The y-coordinate of the position to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the position can be occupied or passed through, False otherwise.
    """
    # Check if the tile at the specified position is blocked
    return self.tiles[y][x].t != 1
```
    Returns

    ```python
def point_collide(pos_x, pos_y):
    """
    Determines if a specific position on the map is blocked.

    Args:
        pos_x (int): The x-coordinate of the position to check.
        pos_y (int): The y-coordinate of the position to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the position is not blocked (has an attribute 't' equal to 0),
              False if the position is blocked (has an attribute 't' equal to 1).

    Examples:
        >>> point_collide(3, 5)
        False
        >>> point_collide(2, 7)
        True
    """
```
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Check if two points collide within a bounding box
point_a = (10, 20)
point_b = (15, 30)

if point_collide(point_a, point_b):
    print("Points collide.")
else:
    print("Points do not collide.")

# Edge case: Points on the same vertical line at different heights
point_c = (10, 20)
point_d = (10, 40)

if point_collide(point_c, point_d):
    print("Points collide.")
else:
    print("Points do not collide.")

# Advanced scenario: Check if two points within a circular bounding box
circle_center = (50, 50)
circle_radius = 20

point_e = (60, 50)
point_f = (70, 40)

if point_collide(point_e, circle_center, circle_radius):
    print("Points collide.")
else:
    print("Points do not collide.")
```

Note: The `point_collide` function is assumed to be part of a module or library that checks for collision between two points. The specific implementation details are not provided here and should be based on the actual code's functionality.
    Docstring

    """```python
def point_collide(self, x, y):
    """Determine if a given point (x, y) collides with an obstacle.

    Args:
        x (int): The x-coordinate of the point to check.
        y (int): The y-coordinate of the point to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the point is not in collision with an obstacle, False otherwise.

    Examples:

        >>> point_collide(0, 0)  # Point (0, 0) is not in collision
