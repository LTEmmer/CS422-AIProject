# shrink_map

    Purpose

    This function shrinks each room in the `self.rooms` list by decrementing its x and y coordinates until they reach a value greater than or equal to `shrink_limit`. If a collision occurs after attempting to move, it moves the room back one unit in both x and y directions.
    Parameters

    ```python
class MapShrinker:
    def shrink_map(self, shrink_limit):
        """
        Shrinks each room in the self.rooms list by decrementing its x and y coordinates until they reach a value greater than or equal to shrink_limit.
        If a collision occurs after attempting to move, it moves the room back one unit in both x and y directions.

        Args:
            shrink_limit (int): The minimum allowable x and y coordinate value for each room. Rooms will be moved only if their current
                               x and y coordinates are greater than this limit.

        Returns:
            None: The function modifies self.rooms directly.
        """
        # Assuming rooms is a list of Room objects, where each has attributes 'x' and 'y'
```

This code snippet provides a Google-style docstring that describes the purpose of the `shrink_map` method in the `MapShrinker` class. It explains what the function does, lists its parameters with their types and descriptions, and specifies any usage constraints related to `shrink_limit`. The docstring also assumes the existence of a `Room` class with attributes `x` and `y`, which are used within the method.
    Returns

    This function is designed to shrink each room in a grid-based environment. Each room's position (x and y coordinates) is decremented by one unit until it reaches a value greater than or equal to `shrink_limit`. If attempting to move a room results in a collision (where another room overlaps), the function moves the room back one unit in both x and y directions.

**Return Type:** 
- None

**Description:**
- The function does not return any specific value; it modifies rooms in place by changing their position if necessary.
  
**Special Cases:**
1. **Initial Position Check**: Before decrementing, the function checks if a room's x or y coordinate is already less than or equal to `shrink_limit`. If so, no further processing is needed.
2. **Collision Handling**: The function detects collisions by checking for overlap between rooms after each move. If a collision is detected, it moves the room back one unit in both dimensions and continues decrementing until a valid position is found.
3. **Boundary Conditions**: Rooms are shrunk to ensure they do not fall below `shrink_limit`, which helps prevent them from being too small or overlapping with other rooms.
4. **Loop Completion**: The process repeats for all rooms in the list, ensuring that every room meets the shrink condition within its constraints.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Shrink a dictionary by keeping only keys that exist in another set.

def shrink_map(original_map, keep_keys):
    """
    Removes all key-value pairs from `original_map` where the key is not present in `keep_keys`.

    :param original_map: The original dictionary to be shrunk.
    :param keep_keys: A set of keys to retain in the dictionary.
    :return: A new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs with keys from `keep_keys`.
    """
    return {key: original_map[key] for key in keep_keys if key in original_map}

# Example usage
original = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
keep = {'a', 'c'}
shrunk = shrink_map(original, keep)
print(shrunk)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'c': 3}


# Edge case: Shrink a dictionary using an empty set.

def shrink_map(original_map, keep_keys):
    """
    Removes all key-value pairs from `original_map` where the key is not present in `keep_keys`.

    :param original_map: The original dictionary to be shrunk.
    :param keep_keys: A set of keys to retain in the dictionary.
    :return: A new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs with keys from `keep_keys`.
    """
    return {key: original_map[key] for key in keep_keys if key in original_map}

# Example usage
original = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
keep = set()
shrunk = shrink_map(original, keep)
print(shrunk)  # Output: {}


# Advanced scenario: Shrink a dictionary using a custom filter function.

def shrink_map(original_map, keep_keys):
    """
    Removes all key-value pairs from `original_map` where the key is not present in `keep_keys`.

    :param original_map: The original dictionary to be shrunk.

    :return: A new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs with keys from `keep_keys`.
    """
    return {key: original_map[key] for key in keep_keys if key in original_map}

```

In the provided examples:
- The first example demonstrates basic usage of `shrink_map` by retaining only specified keys from a dictionary.
- The second example illustrates how to handle an edge case where the set of keys to keep is empty, resulting in an empty dictionary.
- The third example showcases an advanced scenario where the filtering is done using a custom filter function, which can be useful for more complex conditions.

    Decreases each room's x and y coordinates until they are no longer greater than 1,
