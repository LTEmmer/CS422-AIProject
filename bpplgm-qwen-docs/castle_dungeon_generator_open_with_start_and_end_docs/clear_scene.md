# clear_scene

    Purpose

    The function `clear_scene()` clears all objects in the currently active scene by first ensuring the active object is in Object mode, then selecting and deleting all selected objects globally.
    Parameters

    ```python
def clear_scene():
    """
    Clears all objects in the currently active scene by ensuring the active object is in Object mode and selecting and deleting all selected objects globally.

    Usage:
        # Clear all objects in the current scene
        clear_scene()
    """

    # Ensure the active object is in Object mode
    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')

    # Select all objects globally
    bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')

    # Delete all selected objects
    bpy.ops.object.delete(use_global=True)
```

**Examples:**

```python
# Clear all objects in the current scene
clear_scene()
```
This function will clear all objects in the active scene, effectively removing them from the scene. It ensures that the active object is in Object mode before performing any deletions to prevent unexpected behavior.
    Returns

    ```python
def clear_scene():
    """
    Clears all objects in the currently active scene.

    The function ensures that the active object is in Object mode before selecting and deleting all selected objects globally.

    Returns:
        None

    Special Cases:
        - If there are no objects to delete, the function will not return any value but will simply complete execution without errors.

    # Function implementation as provided
```
    Examples

    ```python
# Clearing a simple scene
clear_scene()
```

This function clears all objects from the current scene. It's useful for resetting a game state or starting over with new content.

```python
# Edge case: Trying to clear an already empty scene
clear_scene()
```

This example demonstrates that calling `clear_scene` on an empty scene has no effect, as there are no objects to remove.

```python
# Advanced scenario: Clearing the scene and then adding new objects
clear_scene()
add_object('player')
add_object('enemy')
```

This sequence first clears the scene, then adds a player and an enemy. After clearing, these objects are added to the current scene.
    Docstring

    """```python
def clear_scene():
    """
    Clears the current scene by selecting and deleting all objects.

    This function ensures that only object mode is active before performing any deletions. It selects all objects in the scene and deletes them without affecting other scenes or collections.

        None

    Returns:
        None

    Examples:
        >>> clear_scene()
