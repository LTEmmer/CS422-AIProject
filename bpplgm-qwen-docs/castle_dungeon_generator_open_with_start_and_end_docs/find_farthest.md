# find_farthest

    Purpose

    This function calculates the pair of rooms in a list that are farthest apart by comparing the Euclidean distance between their centers. It updates the `first_room` and `last_room` attributes with these farthest rooms and returns them as a tuple.
    Parameters

    ```python
def find_farthest(self):
    """
    Calculates and returns the pair of rooms in a list that are farthest apart by comparing the Euclidean distance between their centers.

    Args:
        self: The instance of the RoomList class containing a list of Room objects to compare.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing two Room objects representing the pair of rooms with the maximum Euclidean distance.
    """
    # Assuming Room has an attribute `center` which is a point object (x, y)

        raise ValueError("At least two rooms are required to find the farthest apart.")

    first_room = self.rooms[0]
    last_room = self.rooms[1]

    for i in range(len(self.rooms)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(self.rooms)):

    Returns

    ```python
def find_farthest(self):
    # Purpose: This function calculates the pair of rooms in a list that are farthest apart by comparing the Euclidean distance between their centers. It updates the `first_room` and `last_room` attributes with these farthest rooms and returns them as a tuple.

    # Return type: A tuple containing two Room objects representing the farthest apart rooms in the list.
    # Description: The function calculates the distances between all pairs of rooms using Euclidean distance, which is the square root of the sum of squared differences between corresponding coordinates. It keeps track of the pair with the maximum distance and updates `first_room` and `last_room` to point to these rooms at the end.

    # Special cases:
    # 1. If there are fewer than two rooms in the list, an empty tuple is returned.
    # 2. If all rooms have the same center or no specific criteria for comparison are provided, the function may not accurately return the farthest apart room(s).
```
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Finds the farthest node from a given start node in a graph using BFS
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B'],
    'E': ['B', 'F'],
    'F': ['C', 'E']
}
start_node = 'A'
farthest_node, distance = find_farthest(graph, start_node)
print(f"The farthest node from {start_node} is {farthest_node} with a distance of {distance}.")
# Explanation: Given a graph and a starting node, the function returns the farthest node from that start node
# and its distance. In this example, 'F' is the farthest node, 3 steps away from 'A'.

# Edge case: Handles an empty graph with no edges
graph = {}
start_node = 'A'
farthest_node, distance = find_farthest(graph, start_node)
print(f"The farthest node from {start_node} is {farthest_node} with a distance of {distance}.")
# Explanation: In this edge case, the function handles an empty graph gracefully by returning None for both
# the farthest node and distance since there are no nodes to consider.

# Advanced scenario: Finds the farthest node in a large directed acyclic graph (DAG)
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': [],
    'C': ['D'],
    'D': ['E'],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': []
}
start_node = 'A'
farthest_node, distance = find_farthest(graph, start_node)
print(f"The farthest node from {start_node} is {farthest_node} with a distance of {distance}.")
# Explanation: This advanced scenario demonstrates the function's capability to handle large graphs
# and different types of structures efficiently. In this DAG example, 'E' is the farthest node, 4 steps away from 'A'.
