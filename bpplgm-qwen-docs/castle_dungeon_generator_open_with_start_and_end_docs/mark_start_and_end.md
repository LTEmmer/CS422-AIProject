# mark_start_and_end

    Purpose

    This function marks the start and end points on a grid map. It randomly selects positions within each room (identified by `first_room` and `last_room`) for these points, ensuring they are not at the edges of their respective rooms, and then sets the terrain type (`t`) of these marked positions to 3 for the end point and 4 for the start point on the grid map.
    Parameters

    ```python
def mark_start_and_end(self):
    """Mark the start and end points on a grid map.

    This function marks the start and end points on a grid map. It randomly selects positions within each room (identified by `first_room` and `last_room`) for these points, ensuring they are not at the edges of their respective rooms, and then sets the terrain type (`t`) of these marked positions to 3 for the end point and 4 for the start point on the grid map.

    Parameters:
        self (GridMap): The current instance of GridMap class representing the game environment.

    Usage Constraints:
        - Ensure that `first_room` and `last_room` are valid room indices within the range of the grid map.
        - This function is typically called at the start of a game or when new locations need to be marked for movement points.
    """
```
    Returns

    ```python
def mark_start_and_end(grid_map, first_room, last_room):
    """
    This function marks the start and end points on a grid map.

    Parameters:
    - grid_map (list of list of int): A 2D grid map where each element represents a cell's terrain type.
    - first_room (tuple): The starting coordinates of the room where the start point will be marked.
    - last_room (tuple): The ending coordinates of the room where the end point will be marked.

    Returns:
    None

    Description:
    The function randomly selects positions within each room to mark as either a start or end point. It ensures that these points are not at the edges of their respective rooms and sets the terrain type of the selected positions to 3 for the end point and 4 for the start point on the grid map.
    
    Special Cases:
    - If the first_room is equal to the last_room, only one point will be marked (either start or end).
    """
```

Examples using the existing code:

```python
# Assuming grid_map, first_room, and last_room are defined as per the function requirements

mark_start_and_end(grid_map, (0, 0), (2, 2))
# This call would mark a random position within room (0, 0) to be the start point (terrain type 4)
# and another random position within room (2, 2) to be the end point (terrain type 3)

mark_start_and_end(grid_map, (1, 1), (1, 1))
# This call would mark a single position at room (1, 1) as both the start and end point
```
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Marking the start and end points of a sequence of numbers.
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
mark_start_and_end(numbers)
print("Start index:", numbers.index(20))
print("End index:", numbers.index(50))

# Edge case: The sequence contains only one element.
single_element_sequence = [5]
mark_start_and_end(single_element_sequence)
print("Start and end index:", numbers.index(5), "since there's only one element")

# Advanced scenario: Marking start and end points with a specific delimiter for each number.
sequence_with_delimiters = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mark_start_and_end(sequence_with_delimiters, delimiter="-")
print("Start and end index:", numbers.index("banana"), "with delimiter '-'")
