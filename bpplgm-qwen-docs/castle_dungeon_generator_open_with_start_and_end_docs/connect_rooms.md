# connect_rooms

    Purpose

    This function generates a random path between two rooms and connects them by setting their type to 1 in the map. It also sets the `c` attribute of both rooms to true if they are connected, and appends them to the `connected` list.
    Parameters

    ```python
def connect_rooms(self, room, closest_room, good):
    """
    This function generates a random path between two rooms and connects them by setting their type to 1 in the map.
    It also sets the `c` attribute of both rooms to true if they are connected, and appends them to the `connected` list.

    Args:
        self: The instance of the Map class.
        room (Room): The first room to connect.
        closest_room (Room): The second room to connect.
        good (bool): A flag indicating whether the connection should be prioritized for a good path.

    Usage Constraints:
        - `room` and `closest_room` must be instances of the Room class within the same Map instance.
        - The function assumes that both rooms are not already connected (checked internally).
    """
```
    Returns

    ```python
def connect_rooms(rooms):
    """
    Generates a random path between two rooms and connects them by setting their type to 1 in the map. It also sets the `c` attribute of both rooms to True if they are connected, and appends them to the `connected` list.

    Args:
        rooms (list): A list containing all rooms in the map.

    Returns:
        None: The function does not return a value.
    """
    # Purpose: This function connects two randomly chosen rooms by setting their type to 1 and adding them to the 'connected' list. It also updates the 'c' attribute of each room if they are connected.
```

**Special Cases:**
- If there are fewer than two rooms in the input list, the function does not perform any connections and returns without modifying anything.
- The function assumes that the rooms provided are distinct and exist within the map. If this assumption is violated, it may cause unexpected behavior or errors.
    Examples

    ### Basic Usage

```python
# Connect two rooms in a building. Each room has a unique identifier.
connect_rooms('Room1', 'Room2')
```

**Explanation**: This example connects Room1 and Room2, allowing them to communicate with each other through the network.

### Edge Case

```python
# Attempt to connect a non-existent room.
try:
    connect_rooms('NonExistentRoom', 'Room2')
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```

**Explanation**: This example attempts to connect a non-existent room ('NonExistentRoom') with Room2. It will raise a `ValueError` because 'NonExistentRoom' does not exist in the system.

### Advanced Scenario

```python
# Connect multiple rooms and verify their connection status.
rooms = ['ConferenceHall', 'Lobby', 'Bathroom']
for i in range(len(rooms)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(rooms)):
        connect_rooms(rooms[i], rooms[j])
```

**Explanation**: This example connects all possible pairs of rooms ('ConferenceHall', 'Lobby', and 'Bathroom') in the building. It ensures that every room is connected to every other room.
    Docstring

    """```python
def connect_rooms(self, room, closest_room, good):
    """
    Connects two rooms by placing a corridor between them and marks their connection status.

    Args:
        room (dict): The first room to be connected.
        closest_room (dict): The second room closest to the first room that is not adjacent.
        good (bool): A flag indicating if this connection should mark both rooms as connected.

    Returns:
        None

    Examples:
        >>> room1 = {'x': 0, 'y': 0, 'w': 10, 'h': 10}
        >>> room2 = {'x': 15, 'y': 5, 'w': 8, 'h': 15}
        >>> map_data = [[{'t': 0} for _ in range(30)] for _ in range(30)]
        >>> connection_manager = ConnectionManager(map_data)
        >>> connection_manager.connect_rooms(room1, room2, True)
        For the provided example, this function will connect `room1` and `room2`
        with a corridor and mark both rooms as connected. The corridors are placed
        randomly between the two rooms.
