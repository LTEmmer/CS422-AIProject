# extrude_down

    Purpose

    The `extrude_down` function calls another function named `extrude` with arguments `0`, `-y_move_distance`, and `0`. This likely creates an extrusion along the Y-axis in a 3D modeling context, moving downwards by the specified distance.
    Parameters

    ```python
def extrude_down(y_move_distance):
    """
    Calls the `extrude` function with arguments (0, -y_move_distance, 0).

    This function is used to create an extrusion along the Y-axis in a 3D modeling context.
    The extrusion moves downwards by the specified distance indicated by `y_move_distance`.

    Parameters:
        y_move_distance (float): The distance in the Y-direction to move the extrusion downwards.

    Usage Constraints:
        - `y_move_distance` must be a positive float or integer. Negative values are not allowed.
    """
```
    Returns

    ```python
def extrude_down(y_move_distance: float) -> None:
    """
    Calls the `extrude` function with arguments (0, -y_move_distance, 0).
    
    This function is designed to create an extrusion along the Y-axis in a 3D modeling context.
    It moves downwards by the specified distance.

    Parameters:
    y_move_distance (float): The downward move distance for the extrusion.

    Returns:
    None

    Special cases:
    - If `y_move_distance` is negative, it will cause an error as the function expects a positive distance.
      However, in practice, this should be handled by checking and converting inputs if necessary.

```

The `extrude_down` function calls another function named `extrude` with arguments `0`, `-y_move_distance`, and `0`. This likely creates an extrusion along the Y-axis in a 3D modeling context, moving downwards by the specified distance. The return type is `None` as the function does not return any value; it only performs an action. Special cases include the requirement that `y_move_distance` must be positive for this function to execute correctly.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Extrude a shape down by 10 units along the Z-axis
result = extrude_down(shape, depth=10)

# Explanation: This function takes an existing shape and extrudes it downwards by the specified depth.
# The `depth` parameter determines how far the object is moved along the Z-axis. In this example,
# the shape is moved 10 units down, creating a new shape that extends 10 units below its original position.

# Edge case: Extrude a shape with zero depth
result = extrude_down(shape, depth=0)

# Explanation: When `depth` is set to 0, no change occurs. The function returns the original shape,
# indicating that there was nothing to extrude, as the specified depth was not sufficient.

# Advanced scenario: Extrude a complex shape with multiple vertices
result = extrude_down(complex_shape, depth=2)

# Explanation: This example demonstrates how to use `extrude_down` on a more intricate shape. The function
# processes each vertex of the complex_shape and moves it down by 2 units along the Z-axis.
```

    """```python
def extrude_down():
    """
    This function extrudes a block downward by `y_move_distance` units.

    Args:
        y_move_distance (float): The distance to move the block downward in the Y-axis.

    Returns:
        None: This function does not return any value.

    Examples:
        >>> extrude_down(2.0)
