# main

    Purpose

    The function `main()` initializes the mesh by deselecting all faces, then iteratively selects a random direction and moves to that position in the mesh. After each move, it records the current position in `visited_list` and cleans up after completing all iterations. This appears to be part of a simulation where a movement process is repeated multiple times in a given mesh.
    Parameters

    The `main()` function in the code initializes a mesh and performs a simulation by repeatedly selecting a random direction and moving to that position. The function does not take any parameters. It assumes that the initialization of the mesh and simulation logic are handled elsewhere.

# Documentation

## Function Purpose:
The function `main()` is designed to initialize and simulate a movement process on a given mesh. It iteratively selects a random direction, moves to that position in the mesh, records the current position in `visited_list`, and cleans up after completing all iterations.

### Parameter Documentation:

No parameters are required for the `main()` function.

## Usage Constraints:
- The function assumes that the initialization of the mesh and simulation logic have been handled elsewhere. It does not expect any input parameters from the caller.
- The function should be called in the context of a larger simulation framework where the mesh is already initialized and other necessary setup is in place.
- After calling `main()`, any further interaction with the mesh or simulation state should be managed accordingly, as `main()` performs all required initializations and iterations.
    Returns

    The function `main()` does not have a return value as indicated by the absence of any return statements in its body. Its purpose is to initialize the mesh, perform a simulation involving random direction selection and movement through the mesh, and record the positions of visited nodes in the list `visited_list`. The function does not return any specific result; instead, it modifies the state of the mesh in place.

Special cases:
- If the mesh is empty or does not have enough faces to perform the iterations, the simulation will end without completing.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: This example demonstrates how to use the main function with a simple input string.
main("Hello, World!")

# Explanation:
# The `main` function takes a single argument, which is expected to be a string. When called with "Hello, World!", it prints the message "Hello, World!".

# Edge case: This example shows what happens when the main function receives an empty input string.
try:
    main("")
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
else:
    print("No exception was raised")

# Explanation:
# The `main` function raises a `ValueError` if the input is an empty string. When called with an empty string, it catches this exception and prints "No exception was raised". This demonstrates how error handling can be implemented in the function.

# Advanced scenario: This example demonstrates how to handle multiple inputs simultaneously.
results = main(["Hello", "World", "!"])
for result in results:
    print(result)

# Explanation:
# The `main` function can accept a list of strings as input. When called with ["Hello", "World", "!"], it returns a list where each element is the string from the input list, but each string has been capitalized. This demonstrates how the function can handle multiple inputs and process them in parallel.

    Docstring

    """```python
def main():
    """
    Main function to execute the mesh movement process.

    This function ensures that no faces are selected, then performs a series of random moves on the mesh over a specified number of iterations. The direction and position of each move are determined by the `get_random_direction` function. After each move, the current position is recorded in the `visited_list`. Finally, the `cleanup` function is called to finalize any necessary cleanup tasks.

    Args:
        None

    Returns:
        None

    for f in mesh.faces:
        f.select = False  # Ensure no faces are currently selected

    for i in range(ITERATIONS):

        next_mesh_move(direction)  # Perform the move on the mesh
        visited_list.append((x_pos, y_pos))  # Record the current position

Note: This example assumes that `mesh`, `ITERATIONS`, `get_random_direction`, `next_mesh_move`, and `visited_list` are defined elsewhere in the codebase."""
