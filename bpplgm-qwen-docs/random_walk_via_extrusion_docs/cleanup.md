# cleanup

    Purpose

    This function uses Blender's Python API to select all vertices in the active mesh object and remove any duplicate vertices, effectively merging them. It operates by entering edit mode, selecting all vertices, performing the duplicate removal operation, and then exiting edit mode. This process is useful for cleaning up messy or redundant data within a 3D model.
    Parameters

    ```python
def cleanup():
    """
    This function uses Blender's Python API to select all vertices in the active mesh object and remove any duplicate vertices, effectively merging them. It operates by entering edit mode, selecting all vertices, performing the duplicate removal operation, and then exiting edit mode.

    Usage:
    - The function assumes that a 3D model is loaded into Blender and is editable.
    - It will select all vertices in the active mesh object, find duplicates, and merge them into single vertices.

This description provides an overview of what the `cleanup` function does, including its purpose and usage constraints.
    Returns

    This function uses Blender's Python API to select all vertices in the active mesh object and remove any duplicate vertices. It operates by entering edit mode, selecting all vertices, performing the duplicate removal operation, and then exiting edit mode.

- **Return Type**: `None`
- **Description**: The function does not return anything; it performs an action on the active mesh object.
- **Special Cases**: This function is intended to clean up redundant data within a 3D model. However, if there are no duplicate vertices in the active mesh object, the function will have no effect and may cause unnecessary computations or delays, especially in large models. Additionally, if Blender is not running or if the selected object is not a mesh, this function will raise an error.

Examples:

```python
import bpy

def cleanup():
    # Enter edit mode for the active object
    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='EDIT')
    
    # Select all vertices in the active mesh
    bpy.ops.mesh.select_all(action='SELECT')
    
    # Remove duplicate vertices
    bpy.ops.mesh.remove_doubles(threshold=0.01, use_unselected=False)
    
    # Exit edit mode
    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')

cleanup()
```
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Removing a directory and its contents
import shutil

def cleanup(directory_path):
    # Removes an entire directory and all its contents if it exists
    shutil.rmtree(directory_path)

# Example usage
cleanup('/path/to/directory')
```

```python
# Edge case: Attempting to clean up a non-existent directory
try:
    import shutil
    def cleanup(directory_path):
        # Removes an entire directory and all its contents if it exists
        shutil.rmtree(directory_path)
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Directory not found: {e}")
```

```python
# Advanced scenario: Cleaning up directories in a list with error handling
import shutil

def cleanup_directories(directory_list):
    # Attempts to clean up multiple directories, printing an error if any fails
    for directory in directory_list:
        try:
            shutil.rmtree(directory)
            print(f"Directory {directory} cleaned.")
        except FileNotFoundError as e:
            print(f"Error cleaning up {directory}: {e}")

# Example usage
directories_to_clean = ['/path/to/directory1', '/path/to/directory2']
cleanup_directories(directories_to_clean)
```

    Cleans up a mesh object by selecting all vertices and removing doubles.

    This function switches to edit mode, selects all vertices, removes any duplicate vertices,
    and then returns to object mode.

    Returns:
        None
