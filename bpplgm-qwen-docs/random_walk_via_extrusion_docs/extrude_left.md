# extrude_left

    Purpose

    The function `extrude_left()` in the given Python code currently executes a command to extrude a volume along the X-axis in a 3D modeling software, specifically moving it by `-x_move_distance` units. This action will create a new volume that extends from the current position of the object on the negative X-axis up until its current position on the positive X-axis.
    Parameters

    ```python
def extrude_left(x_move_distance: float):
    """
    Extrudes a volume along the X-axis in 3D modeling software.

    Parameters:
        x_move_distance (float): The distance to move the volume left. Positive values will extrude from the current position on the negative X-axis to positive X-axis.
            Constraints: Must be a non-negative number, as negative movements are not supported for this operation.
    """
    # This function currently executes a command in 3D modeling software
    # to move a selected volume left by x_move_distance units.
```
    Returns

    ```python
def extrude_left(x_move_distance):
    """
    Moves a volume along the X-axis in 3D modeling software by a specified distance,
    creating a new volume that extends from the current position of the object on the negative
    X-axis up until its current position on the positive X-axis.

    Args:
    x_move_distance (float): The number of units to move the volume along the X-axis.

    Returns:
    None

    Special Cases:
    - If `x_move_distance` is 0, the function does nothing.

    Examples

    ```python
# Example 1: Basic usage
# The 'extrude_left' function takes a list and an integer as arguments. It extrudes (repeats) each element in the list to the left by the specified number of times.
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
n = 2
result = extrude_left(my_list, n)
# result will be [2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1]

# Example 2: Edge case
# If 'n' is zero, the function should return a list with each element repeated once.
my_list = ['a', 'b']
n = 0
result = extrude_left(my_list, n)
# result will be ['a', 'b']

# Example 3: Advanced scenario
# If 'n' is negative, the function should repeat the elements to the right instead of the left. This requires reversing the list before processing.
my_list = [4, 5, 6]
n = -1
result = extrude_left(my_list, n)
# result will be [6, 5, 4, 6, 5, 4]
```

    Args:

    Examples:
