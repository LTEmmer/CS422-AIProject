# next_mesh_move

    Purpose

    The function `next_mesh_move` determines the appropriate face to select in a mesh for an extrusion operation based on the given direction. It checks if the destination point has been visited and selects the face that matches the expected orientation and position, then performs the extrusion process.
    Parameters

    ```python
def next_mesh_move(direction):
    """
    Determines the appropriate face to select in a mesh for an extrusion operation based on the given direction.

    :param direction: The direction in which the extrusion should be performed. This is expected to be a 3D vector indicating the desired movement.
    :type direction: list or tuple of floats, where each float represents a component along x, y, and z axes (e.g., [1.0, 0.0, 0.0] for movement along the positive x-axis).
    :param destination_point: The point in space to which the extrusion will be directed. This is expected to be a tuple of three floats representing the x, y, and z coordinates (e.g., (2.5, 1.2, 3.0)).
    :return: The face that matches the expected orientation and position for the extrusion operation.
    """
```

Examples:
```python
direction = [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
destination_point = (2.5, 1.2, 3.0)
face = next_mesh_move(direction, destination_point)
print(face)  # Outputs the face to be selected for the extrusion operation based on the given direction and destination point.
```
    Returns

    ```python
def next_mesh_move(direction: Tuple[float, float, float]) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """
    Determines the appropriate face to select in a mesh for an extrusion operation based on the given direction.

    :param direction: A tuple representing the vector indicating the desired direction of the extrusion.
    
    :return:
        - A tuple of two integers (face_id, vertex_id) if a suitable face and vertex are found.
        - None if no suitable face and vertex are found.
        
    Special Cases:
        1. If the destination point has been visited in the current path, the function skips it.
        2. If the direction vector is zero, an error should be raised or handled as appropriate.
        3. If there are multiple faces with the same expected orientation and position, the function returns the first one found.

    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Using next_mesh_move to navigate through a sequence of mesh moves.
# In this example, we initialize an object that generates mesh moves and use it to advance through them one by one.

import math

class MeshMoveGenerator:
    def __init__(self, start_angle=0):
        self.angle = start_angle
        self.increment = 10

    def next_mesh_move(self):
        # Calculate the new angle for the next mesh move
        self.angle += self.increment
        return self.angle % 360  # Ensure the angle wraps around 0-359 degrees

# Example usage
generator = MeshMoveGenerator(start_angle=0)
angle_1 = generator.next_mesh_move()  # This will output an angle, e.g., 10
angle_2 = generator.next_mesh_move()  # This will output the next angle, e.g., 20
print("Angle 1:", angle_1)
print("Angle 2:", angle_2)

# Edge case: Using next_mesh_move with a negative increment.
# This example demonstrates how to handle cases where the increment is less than zero.

class MeshMoveGenerator:
    def __init__(self, start_angle=0):
        self.angle = start_angle
        self.increment = -10

    def next_mesh_move(self):
        # Calculate the new angle for the next mesh move
        self.angle += self.increment
        return self.angle % 360  # Ensure the angle wraps around 0-359 degrees

# Example usage
generator = MeshMoveGenerator(start_angle=0)
angle_1 = generator.next_mesh_move()  # This will output an angle, e.g., 340
angle_2 = generator.next_mesh_move()  # This will output the next angle, e.g., 350
print("Angle 1:", angle_1)
print("Angle 2:", angle_2)

# Advanced scenario: Using next_mesh_move to generate a sequence of mesh moves with specific constraints.
# This example demonstrates how to handle cases where multiple increments are needed.

class MeshMoveGenerator:
    def __init__(self, start_angle=0):
        self.angle = start_angle
        self.increment = 15

    def next_mesh_move(self):
        # Calculate the new angle for the next mesh move
        self.angle += self.increment
        return self.angle % 360  # Ensure the angle wraps around 0-359 degrees

# Example usage
generator = MeshMoveGenerator(start_angle=180)
angles = [generator.next_mesh_move() for _ in range(4)]
print("Generated angles:", angles)

    Docstring

    """```python

    Determines the next face to extrude based on the given direction.

    Args:
        direction (str): The direction ('up', 'right', 'down', 'left') to move in.

        None

    Examples:
