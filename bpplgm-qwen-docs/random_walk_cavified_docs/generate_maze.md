# generate_maze

    Purpose

    This function generates a maze by iterating through a specified number of iterations, randomly selecting and executing movements in each iteration. After all iterations are complete, it cleans up the mesh and performs cavification operations on the generated maze.
    Parameters

    ```python
def generate_maze(iterations: int):
    """
    Generate a maze by iterating through the specified number of iterations.

    Parameters:
    - iterations (int): The total number of iterations to complete for generating the maze.

    This function generates a maze by executing movements in each iteration, where a movement consists of moving from one point
    to another within the current area of the maze. After all iterations are complete, it cleans up the mesh and performs cavification operations on the generated maze.
    """
```
    Returns

    This function does not return a value. It performs a series of operations on a mesh to generate a maze by iterating through specified movements a certain number of times. After processing, it cleans up the mesh and applies cavification operations.

Special Cases:
- The function modifies the input mesh directly.
- No specific return type is defined as it does not return any value.
    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Generates a simple 10x10 maze with walls and paths.
generate_maze(10, 10)

# Edge case: Generates a 1x1 maze, which is just a single cell without any walls or paths.
generate_maze(1, 1)

# Advanced scenario: Generates a maze that includes diagonal moves allowed. This is done by setting
# the `allow_diagonal` parameter to True when calling generate_maze.
generate_maze(10, 10, allow_diagonal=True)
```
    Docstring

    """```python
def generate_maze():
    """
    Generate a maze by iterating through a specified number of iterations,
    choosing random directions to move, and updating the mesh accordingly.

    Args:
        None

    Returns:
        None

    Examples:
    >>> generate_maze()
    The maze is generated using 100 iterations and updates the mesh and cavifies it.
