# cleanup_mesh

    Purpose

    This function cleans up a 3D model by joining separate cube objects into one, removing overlapping vertices, and then de-selecting the "interior faces" to leave a hollow mesh behind. It uses Blender's BMesh library for manipulating the mesh data in edit mode.
    Parameters

    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Cleanup a simple mesh with vertices and faces
mesh = Mesh()
cleanup_mesh(mesh)

# Explanation:
# The `cleanup_mesh` function takes a mesh object as input and performs several cleanup operations.
# It removes any duplicate vertices, collapses degenerate triangles (faces), and ensures that all edges have at least two adjacent faces.
# This is useful for preparing meshes for further processing or rendering.

```python
# Edge case: Cleanup a mesh with holes
mesh = Mesh()
cleanup_mesh(mesh)
# Explanation:
# The function still handles the removal of duplicate vertices, degenerate triangles, and self-intersections.
# However, it may not fully address holes in the mesh. Holes could be detected by checking for faces that are completely enclosed.
# In such cases, additional logic would be needed to identify and close these gaps.

```python
# Advanced scenario: Cleanup a complex mesh with multiple sub-meshes and different topologies
mesh = Mesh()
cleanup_mesh(mesh)
# Explanation:
# The function can handle meshes with multiple sub-meshes and varying topological structures.
# It ensures that all vertices, faces, and edges are correctly processed across these sub-meshes.
# This capability is crucial for handling complex geometries and ensuring a uniform cleanup process throughout the mesh.
