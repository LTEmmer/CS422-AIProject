# place_cube

    Purpose

    The function `place_cube` adds a cube to the Blender scene with a size of 2 units and places it at coordinates (x_pos, y_pos, 0). It does not edit the mesh in edit mode after creation. The function takes two parameters: `x_pos` and `y_pos`, which specify the position on the X and Y axes respectively.
    Parameters

    ```python
def place_cube(x_pos: float, y_pos: float):
    """
    Adds a cube to the Blender scene with a size of 2 units and places it at coordinates (x_pos, y_pos, 0).

    Parameters:
        x_pos (float): The X position on the scene where the cube should be placed.
        y_pos (float): The Y position on the scene where the cube should be placed.

    Usage Constraints:
        - `x_pos` and `y_pos` must be valid floating-point numbers.
        - This function does not edit the mesh in edit mode after creation, so any modifications to the cube will need to be done separately using Blender's editing tools.
    """
```
    Returns

    ```python
def place_cube(x_pos: float, y_pos: float) -> None:
    """
    Adds a cube to the Blender scene with a size of 2 units and places it at coordinates (x_pos, y_pos, 0).
    
    Parameters:
        x_pos (float): The X-coordinate where the cube should be placed.
        y_pos (float): The Y-coordinate where the cube should be placed.

    Returns:
        None

    Special Cases:
        - If `x_pos` or `y_pos` is not a finite number, an error will occur when creating the cube.
        - The function does not edit the mesh in edit mode after creation.

    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage: Place a cube at position (0, 0, 0) with size 2
place_cube(0, 0, 0, 2)
```

This example demonstrates how to place a cube at the origin (x=0, y=0, z=0) in a 3D space with dimensions of 2 units on each side.

```python
# Edge case: Place a cube at an invalid position
place_cube(5, -10, 7, 3)
```

This example shows how to place a cube at an invalid position where the x-coordinate is greater than 4, which would cause an error or unexpected behavior depending on the system's handling of out-of-bounds coordinates.

```python
# Advanced scenario: Place multiple cubes with different sizes and positions
place_cube(10, 20, 30, 5)  # Large cube at (10, 20, 30)
place_cube(-5, -15, -25, 1)   # Tiny cube at (-5, -15, -25)
place_cube(4, 8, 12, 3)     # Medium cube at (4, 8, 12)
```

This example demonstrates how to place multiple cubes with different sizes and positions in a 3D space. It showcases the flexibility of the function to accommodate various configurations, which could be useful for more complex scenarios such as object placement in a simulation or game environment.
    Docstring

    """```python
def place_cube():
    """Place a cube in the scene at a given position (x_pos, y_pos).

    Args:
        x_pos (float): The X-coordinate where the cube should be placed.
        y_pos (float): The Y-coordinate where the cube should be placed.

    Returns:
        None: The function does not return any value.
    
    Examples:
        >>> place_cube(x_pos=1.0, y_pos=2.5)
        A cube will be added to the scene at position (1.0, 2.5, 0).
        
        >>> place_cube(x_pos=-3.0, y_pos=4.0)
        Another cube will be placed in the scene at position (-3.0, 4.0, 0).
