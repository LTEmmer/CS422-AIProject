# TestHello

    Purpose

    ## Overview

This Python class, `TestHello`, is a unit test class designed to verify the functionality of the `say` method in the `hello` module.

## Functionality Documentation

The `test_hello` method within this class serves as a test case for the `say` method. It creates an instance of `hello` and calls its `say` method with the argument `'world'`, then asserts that the result is equal to the expected string value, `'Hello world!'`.

    """```python
class TestHello(unittest.TestCase):
    """
    A unit test class for the hello module.

    This class contains a single test method, `test_hello`, which checks if the hello function correctly prints 'Hello world!' to the console when called with 'world' as an argument.
    """

    def test_hello(self):
        # The 'hello.say('world')" is executed by calling the say() method on the hello object and passing 'world' as a string argument.
        s = hello.say('world')
        # The `assertEqual` method checks if the result of the function call is equal to the expected output, which in this case is 'Hello world!'.
        self.assertEqual(s, 'Hello world!')
