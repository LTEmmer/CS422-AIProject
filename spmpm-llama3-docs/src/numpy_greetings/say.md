# say

    Purpose

    This function is a simple method that calls another method `say` on an object of class `greetings.hello`, which itself appears to be a subclass of the built-in Python `str` type. The purpose of this function is to invoke a method of its parent class, passing it an array-like object as input.
    Parameters

    ```python
def say(self):
    """
    Invokes a method on an object of class greetings.hello passing an array-like object as input.

    Parameters:
    None

    Description:
    This function calls another method 'say' on an object of class greetings.hello, which itself appears to be a subclass of the built-in Python str type.
    The purpose of this function is to invoke a method of its parent class, passing it an array-like object as input.

    Usage Constraints:
    None

    ```python
def say(self, test_numpy):
    """
    Returns a string containing greetings messages.

    This function is a simple method that calls another method `say` on an object of class `greetings.hello`,

    Return Type: str

    Description:
        A string containing greetings messages.

    Special Cases:
        - If test_numpy is None, an empty string is returned.
        - If test_numpy is not an array-like object, the function raises a TypeError.
        - If the object of class `greetings.hello` does not have a method named 'say', 
          or if the argument to 'say' is not callable, the function raises a TypeError.

    Examples

    ```python
# Basic usage
def say(name: str) -> None:
    """Prints a greeting message with the given name."""
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Edge case
def say(name: str, greeting: str = "Hello") -> None:
    """Prints a personalized greeting message with the given name and optional greeting."""
    print(f"{greeting}, {name}!")
```

    Args:

    words = text.split()
    count = len(words)
