# alive_calc

    Purpose

    Purpose of the function:
    
    The function calculates the alive status of a character based on a random chance.
    It returns True if the character has a chance to start alive, and False otherwise.
    
    It is used in a simulation where a character is chosen at random and checked to see if they're alive.
    
    ```python
    def alive_calc():
    if random() < CHANCE_TO_START_ALIVE:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Example 1: Basic usage
alive_calc(10, 1, 'alive', 'dead')

"""
Explanation:
This function is used to calculate whether a person is alive based on their age, gender, and marital status.
The function takes in 4 parameters:
    - age: int, the person's age
    - gender: str, "male" or "female"
    - marital_status: str, "married" or "single"
    - alive: str, "alive" or "dead"

If the person is male and not married, they are considered alive.
If the person is female, they are considered alive.
If the person is married and is at least 18 years old, they are considered alive.
If the person is not married and is 17 years old or younger, they are considered alive.
If the person's age is 18, they are considered alive.

Note: The function does not validate the input parameters.
