# generate_map

    Purpose

    The function generates a map of cells with a given number of iterations. Each iteration is a step in the game of life. The function also has a function that performs the game of life iteration and returns a new map.

    The function initializes a new level_map with random values. The function also has a function that performs the game of life iteration and returns a new map.

    The function then creates a new level_map with the same size as the original map. The function also has a function that performs the game of life iteration and returns a new map.

    The function then creates a new level_map with the same size as the original map. The function also has a function that performs the game of life iteration and returns a new map.

    Code generation:
    ```python
    print(generate_map(x, y, r, n))
    ```

Example:
```python
def generate_map(x, y, r, n):
    """
    Generates a map with n cells, with coordinates (x, y)
    as the center. The radius r defines the size of the
    circle.

    Returns a list of coordinates in the format [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ...]

    return [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ...]
```

## Edge case

Edge case is a condition where the function encounters an issue,
such as the input parameters are out of range, or the input parameters are not of the correct type.
The function should gracefully handle these edge cases and return appropriate error messages or
invalid results. This is especially important when using functions in production code,
as such edge cases are usually detected and handled before they reach the production code.

## Advanced scenario

This is an advanced scenario where the function needs to perform a specific operation
on the input parameters, such as computing a complex formula.
For example, suppose we have a function that generates a map with n cells,
with coordinates (x, y) as the center. The radius r defines the size of the circle.
The function computes the coordinates of all cells inside the circle and returns them in a list.
We want to demonstrate the function call and return values for the following input parameters:

### Input parameters:

- x, y: coordinates of the center of the circle
- r: radius of the circle
- n: number of cells to generate

### Expected result

The function call should look like this:

```python
generate_map(x, y, r, n)
```

### Explanation

The function should compute a set of coordinates for n cells
inside the circle, and return them as a list. The coordinates should be
in the format [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ...]

### Output

The function should return a list of coordinates in the format [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ...]

```python
def generate_map(x, y, r, n):
    """
    Generates a map with n cells, with coordinates (x, y)
    as the center. The radius r defines the s
