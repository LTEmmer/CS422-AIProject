# clear_scene

    Purpose

    ## Explanation:
    - The clear_scene() function uses the Blender API to delete all objects in the scene. It is used to remove any pre-existing objects from the scene and prepares the scene for the next stage of the game.

    ## Possible Use Cases:
    - This function is used to clear the scene after the end of each level.
    - It could be used to clear any other pre-existing objects in the scene, such as skyboxes, trees, or other background elements.

    ## Possible Improvements:
    - The clear_scene() function currently does not take any arguments, so it would be impossible to customize its behavior in a practical scenario.
    - The code could be enhanced by adding additional parameters to control which objects should be deleted and how many of each should be deleted.

    ## Notes:
    - The function is not designed to be called directly and should only be called by the game engine.
    - The function should be modified to take arguments based on the specific use case or needs of the game.
    - The function should be modified to be called consistently throughout the game, such as in the main loop or game loop.

    ## Description:
    - The function is used to create a new Blender scene with the name "Scene" if it does not already exist. It also configures the Blender viewport to be in edit mode.

    ## Arguments:
    - None

    ## Return Value:
    - None

    ## Use Cases:
    - The function is used to create a new scene when the game starts or restarts.
    - It also ensures that the Blender viewport is set to edit mode, which is necessary for most Blender operations.

    ## Improvements:
    - The code could be enhanced by adding additional parameters to control which objects should be deleted and how many of each should be deleted.

    ## Notes:
    - The function is not designed to be called directly and should only be called by the game engine.
