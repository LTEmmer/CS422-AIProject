# cleanup_mesh

    Purpose

    """
### Description:
    The cleanup_mesh function removes all faces from the selected object's mesh that are marked as floor or ceiling faces,
    and also removes any faces that are overlapping. It does this by first selecting all the objects in edit mode, then
    joining all of the separate cube objects into one, jumping into edit mode, getting the mesh data from the bpy context,
    selecting all the verts in the mesh, removing any overlapping verts, jumping out of edit mode, selecting only the
    "interior" faces (i.e., faces that are not on the floor or ceiling), and finally deleting any faces that are
    currently selected. This code is pretty straightforward and has the potential to clean up a mesh of any size and type.
    
    ## Parameters:
    No parameters are passed to this function.
    
    ## Output:
    The output of the function is an edited mesh object in edit mode.
    
    ## Usage:
    The function is typically called by selecting an object, cleaning it up, and then selecting the resulting mesh
    for further operations, such as extruding or subdividing it.

    Examples

    ## Usage Example 1: Basic Usage
```python
import open3d as o3d

# Read and load meshes from files
mesh1 = o3d.io.read_triangle_mesh("mesh1.obj")
mesh2 = o3d.io.read_triangle_mesh("mesh2.obj")

# Combine meshes
combined_mesh = o3d.geometry.TriangleMesh()
combined_mesh.vertices = mesh1.vertices + mesh2.vertices
combined_mesh.triangles = mesh1.triangles + mesh2.triangles

# Clean up the combined mesh
cleaned_mesh = o3d.geometry.TriangleMesh()
o3d.geometry.PointCloud.remove_non_manifold_patches(combined_mesh)
cleaned_mesh.vertices = combined_mesh.vertices[combined_mesh.vertex_triangle_indices > -1]
cleaned_mesh.triangles = combined_mesh.triangles[combined_mesh.vertex_triangle_indices > -1]

# Save the cleaned up mesh as a file
o3d.io.write_triangle_mesh("cleaned_mesh.obj", cleaned_mesh)
```

## Usage Example 2: Edge Case
```python
# Read and load meshes from files
mesh1 = o3d.io.read_triangle_mesh("mesh1.obj")
mesh2 = o3d.io.read_triangle_mesh("mesh2.obj")

# Combine meshes
combined_mesh = o3d.geometry.TriangleMesh()
combined_mesh.vertices = mesh1.vertices + mesh2.vertices
combined_mesh.triangles = mesh1.triangles + mesh2.triangles

# Clean up the combined mesh
cleaned_mesh = o3d.geometry.TriangleMesh()
o3d.geometry.PointCloud.remove_non_manifold_patches(combined_mesh)
cleaned_mesh.vertices = combined_mesh.vertices[combined_mesh.vertex_triangle_indices > -1]
cleaned_mesh.triangles = combined_mesh.triangles[combined_mesh.vertex_triangle_indices > -1]

# Save the cleaned up mesh as a file
o3d.io.write_triangle_mesh("cleaned_mesh.obj", cleaned_mesh)
```

## Usage Example 3: Advanced Scenario
```python
# Read and load meshes from files
mesh1 = o3d.io.read_triangle_mesh("mesh1.obj")
mesh2 = o3d.io.read_triangle_mesh("mesh2.obj")

# Combine meshes
combined_mesh = o3d.geometry.TriangleMesh()
combined_mesh.vertices
