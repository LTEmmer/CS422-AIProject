# cleanup_mesh

    Purpose

    Purpose of the code:
    This Python function is used to process and clean up the mesh data in Blender.
    It first selects all of the cubes in the scene, joins all of the separate cube objects into one, enters edit mode, 
    saves the mesh data into a variable, removes overlapping verts, enters edit mode, selects all of the interior faces, 
    de-selects all of the "floor" and "ceiling" faces by checking normals, and deletes all still selected faces, leaving a hollow mesh behind.
    The function is used in the "Cleanup" tab in Blender's "
    Parameters

    If you're unable to describe the code in natural language, you can describe it in plain English.
