# random_number

    Purpose

    ### The main purpose of this function is to generate random numbers in a specified range.

    ### The parameters of the function are `minimum` and `maximum`.

    ### The code uses the `random.random()` function to generate a random number between 0 and 1.

    ### The code then multiplies this number by the range (maximum - minimum + 1) to get a number between minimum and maximum, including minimum but not maximum.

    ### The code then adds 1 to this number to get a number between minimum and maximum, including minimum and maximum.

    ### The code then returns this number as a random number between minimum and maximum.

    ### The code is indented with a tab.

    ### The code uses a function called `floor()` from the `math` module.

    Examples

    Make the output format consistent and readable.
    Provide a concise and easy-to-understand explanation of each example.
    Keep it short and to the point.
    Be sure to provide any necessary assumptions or constraints before stating code.
    Ensure you don't enclose the code in triple-backticks, e.g.: ```python code ```.

    For example:
    ```python
    """
    # Explanation
    import random

    random_number = random.random()
    print(random_number)
    ```

    Note: The code above generates a random number between 0 and 1 and prints it.

    Edge Cases:
    - Empty list
    - Empty tuple
    - Empty dictionary
