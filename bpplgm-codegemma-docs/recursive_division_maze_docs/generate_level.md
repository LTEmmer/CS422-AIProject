    Examples

    Only use the code as-is. Do not add any comments.

    Example:
    ```python
    # Explanation
    ```

    Explanation: This code is responsible for generating and rendering the game screen. It includes code for drawing the game board, handling user interactions (clicks and keyboard input), and updating the game state based on user input.


    ## Edge Case: Empty Screen
    ```python
    def empty_screen():
        """
        Display the initial screen with empty board, player, and game over text.

        This function is responsible for rendering the initial empty screen.
        """
        # Explanation
        ```

    ## Advanced Scenario: Dynamic Game Logic
    ```python
    def generate_level(level):
        """
        Generate the level based on the given level number.

        This function generates the level based on the provided level number.
        """
        # Explanation

    ## Edge Case: No Level Input
    ```python
    def generate_level(level):
        """
        Generate the level based on the given level number.

        This function generates the level based on the provided level number.
