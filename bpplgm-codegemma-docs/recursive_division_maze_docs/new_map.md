# new_map

    Purpose

    The function `new_map` creates a new map of `size` by `size` with `value` in each cell.

    The function `new_map` takes in a `size` parameter and a `value` parameter. The `value` parameter is used to populate the cells of the new map. The function creates an empty list and fills it with a list of `size` `value`s. The function then creates a new list and fills it with `size` new lists. The final list is returned.

    The function `new_map` is a common programming pattern used in many programs. It is used to create a new map of a given size with a given value. The function takes in a `size` parameter and returns a new map of `size` by `size` with `value` in each cell.

    #### 1. Basic Usage:
    ```python
    def new_map(old_map, func):
        new_map = {}
        for key, value in old_map.items():
            new_map[key] = func(value)
        return new_map
    ```

    ### 2. Edge Case:
    ```python
    def new_map(old_map, func):
        new_map = {}
        for key, value in old_map.items():
            new_map[key] = func(value)
        return new_map
    ```

    ### 3. Advanced Scenario (if applicable):
    ```python
    def new_map(old_map, func):

        for key, value in old_map.items():
            new_map[key] = func(value)
        return new_map
