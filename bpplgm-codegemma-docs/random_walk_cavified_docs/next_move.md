# next_move

    Purpose

    This function is responsible for moving the cube in a direction and placing the cube on the board. The function takes in a string direction as an argument and performs the following actions:

    1. If the direction is 'up', the y_pos variable is incremented by Y_MOVE_DISTANCE. The cube is placed on the board.
    2. If the direction is 'right', the x_pos variable is incremented by X_MOVE_DISTANCE. The cube is placed on the board.
    3. If the direction is 'down', the y_pos variable is decremented by Y_MOVE_DISTANCE. The cube is placed on the board.
    4. If the direction is 'left', the x_pos variable is decremented by X_MOVE_DISTANCE. The cube is placed on the board.

    The function also includes a call to the place_cube() function, which is responsible for placing the cube on the board. The function is called in the next_move() function, and is responsible for moving the cube in a specific direction.

    This function is used to move the cube in a specific direction, and is called in a loop that continues until the cube reaches the top of the board.
    ```python
    def next_move(direction):
    global y_pos
    global x_pos

    if direction == 'up':
        y_pos += Y_MOVE_DISTANCE
        place_cube()

    if direction == 'right':
        x_pos += X_MOVE_DISTANCE
        place_cube()

    if direction == 'down':
        y_pos -= Y_MOVE_DISTANCE
        place_cube()

    if direction == 'left':
        x_pos -= X_MOVE_DISTANCE
        place_cube()
    ```
