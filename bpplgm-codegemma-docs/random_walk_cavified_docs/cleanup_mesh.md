    If you do offer suggestions, refactorings, or code improvements,
    you should state why you chose those changes, why they're better than
    the original code, and why they're better than the original code.

    If you do offer suggestions, refactorings, or code improvements,
    you should state those changes in a comment, as if you were writing
    a test case.

    ### Description:
    ###   - Summary of the code and its purpose
    ###
    ### Dependencies:
    ###   - Python
    ###   - Package (import numpy as np)

    ###
    ### Function Description:
    ###   - Description of the function, including parameters, return type, and logic
    ###
    ###   - The function takes in a list of dictionaries representing mesh objects, and returns a list of dictionaries representing the same mesh but with duplicated nodes removed.

    ###   - If 'cleanup_mesh' is called with an empty list of meshes as input, it returns an empty list of meshes as output.

    ###   - The function removes duplicated nodes from the mesh, leaving behind only the unique nodes and duplicated edges.

    ###   - The duplicated nodes are identified based on the 'coordinates' field of each dictionary in the input list of meshes.

    ###   - The duplicated nodes are removed from the mesh, leaving behind only unique nodes and duplicated edges.

    ###   - The function also removes duplicated edges from the mesh, leaving only unique nodes and duplicated edges.

    ###   - The function also removes duplicated faces from the mesh, leaving behind only unique faces.

    ###   - The function also removes duplicated vertices from the mesh, leaving behind only unique vertices.

    ###   - The function also removes duplicated nodes from the mes
