# count_alive_neighbors

    Purpose

    This function is a simple game of life simulation that operates on a grid of cells represented by True/False values. The simulation proceeds through the generation of living cells.

    - The function takes three arguments: *live_map*, a boolean matrix representing the current state of the game grid, *x*, an integer representing the x-coordinate of the current cell, and *y*, an integer representing the y-coordinate of the current cell.
    - The function initializes a variable called *count* to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of living neighbors for the current cell.
    - The function uses a while loop to iterate over each neighbor of the current cell, i and j, starting from -1 (to include the current cell itself) and going up to 1, to check if any of the neighboring cells are alive.
    - The function uses an if statement to check if the neighboring cell is outside the bounds of the live_map or is off the edge. If so, it adds 1 to *count* to account for the current cell being checked.
    - The function then uses an elif statement to check if the neighboring cell is alive. If it is, it adds 1 to *count* to account for the current cell being checked.
    - The function then returns the value of *count* after iterating over all neighbors of the current cell.

    The function is then called in a loop that iterates over the entire live_map and calls the count_alive_neighbors function for each cell. The result is printed for each cell, along with its corresponding x and y coordinates.

    The function does not have any return statements, but it does use print statements to output the x, y, and count values for each cell.

    The purpose of this function is to provide a simplified model for simulating the game of life in a 2D grid.
