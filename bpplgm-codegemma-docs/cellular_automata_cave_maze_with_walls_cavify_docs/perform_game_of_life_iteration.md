# perform_game_of_life_iteration

    Purpose

    *Description:* The function performs a single iteration of the Game of Life game. It takes in a 2D list of cells, with each cell represented as a boolean value (True if it's open, False if it's a wall). The function counts the number of live neighbors (open or closed) for each cell in the list and then decides whether to open or close the cell in the next iteration. The function returns a new 2D list of cells representing the next iteration of the Game of Life.
    
    *Complexity:* The function has a time complexity of O(W * H), where W is the width of the input list and H is the height. This is because the function loops over all the cells in the input list and performs a constant time operation for each cell.
    
    *Efficiency:* The function is implemented using a simple algorithm that runs in a constant time. It doesn't make use of any loops or recursion, so it is a very efficient and efficient implementation.
    
    *Input:* The function takes in a 2D list of cells representing the current state of the level.
    
    *Output:* The function returns a new 2D list of cells representing the next iteration of the Game of Life.
    
    *Constraints:* The function assumes that the input list is a valid 2D list of cells and that it has a width and height that is between 1 and 100.
