    Examples

    ### 1. Basic usage
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    from numpy.typing import ArrayLike

    def cleanup_mesh(mesh: ArrayLike, tolerance: float = 1e-9):
        """
        Cleanup a triangular mesh.

        Args:
            mesh: A 2D triangular mesh.
            tolerance: The tolerance of the mesh.

        Returns:
            A cleaned triangular mesh.
        """
        cleaned_mesh = mesh.copy()

        return cleaned_mesh
    ```

    ### 2. Edge case
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    from numpy.typing import ArrayLike

    def cleanup_mesh(mesh: ArrayLike, tolerance: float = 1e-9):
        """
        Cleanup a triangular mesh.

        Args:
            mesh: A 2D triangular mesh.
            tolerance: The tolerance of the mesh.

        Returns:
            A cleaned triangular mesh.
        """
        cleaned_mesh = mesh.copy()

        return cleaned_mesh
    ```

    ### 3. Advanced scenario (if applicable)
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    from numpy.typing import ArrayLike

    def cleanup_mesh(mesh: ArrayLike, tolerance: float = 1e-9):
        """
        Cleanup a triangular mesh.

        Args:
            mesh: A 2D triangular mesh.
            tolerance: The tolerance of the mesh.

        Returns:
            A cleaned triangular mesh.
        """
        cleaned_mesh = mesh.copy()

        return cleaned_mesh
    ```

### A one-line description

```python
def cleanup_mesh():
    # get all the cubes selected
    bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')
    # join all of the separate cube objects into one
    bpy.ops.object.join()
    # jump into edit mode
    bpy.ops.object.editmode_toggle()
    # select all verts
    bpy.ops.mesh.select_all(action='SELECT')
    # remove overlapping verts
    bpy.ops.mesh.remove_doubles()
    # get back out of edit mode
    bpy.ops.object.editmode_toggle()
```
