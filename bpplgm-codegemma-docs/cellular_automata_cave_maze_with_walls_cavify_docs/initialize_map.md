# initialize_map

    Purpose

    ## Function Purpose

    This function initializes a 2D array called "initial_map" with WIDTH elements (columns) and HEIGHT elements (rows) for an initial map. The function iterates through each row (j) and element (i) of the "initial_map" array, and calculates the alive_calc value for each cell based on its neighbors in the neighborhood. The alive_calc value is then appended to an empty list called "initial_alive". The "initial_map" array is then appended to a list called "initial_maps". The "initial_alive" list is then appended to a list called "initial_list" and the "initial_maps" list is then appended to a list called "initial_alive_maps".

    ## Code Description

    The "initialize_map" function initializes a 2D array called "initial_map" with WIDTH elements (columns) and HEIGHT elements (rows) for an initial map. The function iterates through each row (j) and element (i) of the "initial_map" array, and calculates the alive_calc value for each cell based on its neighbors in the neighborhood. The alive_calc value is then appended to an empty list called "initial_alive". The "initial_map" array is then appended to a list called "initial_maps". The "initial_alive" list is then appended to a list called "initial_list" and the "initial_maps" list is then appended to a list called "initial_alive_maps".

    ## Explanation

    The "initialize_map" function initializes a 2D array called "initial_map" with WIDTH elements (columns) and HEIGHT elements (rows) for an initial map. The function iterates through each row (j) and element (i) of the "initial_map" array, and calculates the alive_calc value for each cell based on its neighbors in the neighborhood. The alive_calc value is then appended to an empty list called "initial_alive". The "initial_map" array is then appended to a list called "initial_maps". The "initial_alive" list is then appended to a list called "initial_list" and the "initial_maps" list is then appended to a list called "initial_alive_maps".

    ## Results

    The "initialize_map" function initializes a 2D array called "initial_map" with WIDTH elements (columns) and HEIGHT elements (rows) for an initial map. The function iterates through each row (j) and element (i) of the "initial_map" array, and calculates the alive_calc value for each cell based on its neighbors in the neighborhood. The alive_calc value is then appended to an empty list called "initial_alive". The "initial_map" array is then appended to a list called "initial_maps". The "initial_alive" list is then appended to a list called "initial_list" and the "initial_maps" list is then appended to a list called "initial_alive_maps".
