# place_tile

    Purpose

    - The above code defines a function named "place_tile" that adds a plane mesh to the selected object at the specified position (x, y)
    - The plane is then rotated 90 degrees around the Z-axis, facing the x-axis
    - The plane is then scaled up by a factor of 2 along the x-axis and z-axis
    - The resulting plane is then placed at the specified location (x, y, -1) in the current object
    - The above code uses the "mesh" operator to create a new mesh object, adds a plane to it, and places it at the specified location
    - The resulting plane is then added to the current object using the "mesh" operator
    - The "place_tile" function is then called with the arguments x and y, which are the coordinates of the plane to be added

            This function is used to add a plane mesh to the selected object at the specified position, and rotates and scales the resulting plane.

        - The code defines a function named "place_tile" that takes two arguments: "x" and "y", representing the position of the plane to be added.
        - The function uses the "mesh" operator to create a new mesh object and adds a plane to it.
        - The plane is rotated 90 degrees around the Z-axis, facing the x-axis, and then scaled up along the x-axis and z-axis.
        - The resulting plane is then placed at the specified location (x, y, -1) in the current object using the "mesh" operator.
        - The function returns None, as the resulting plane is added to the current object.

            In summary, this code defines a function called "place_tile" that adds a plane mesh to the selected object at the specified position, and rotates and scales the resulting plane.

    ```python
    def place_tiles(tiles):
    tiles_added = 0
    for x, y in tiles:
    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_plane_add(size=2, enter_editmode=False, location=(x, y, -1))
    tiles_added += 1
    return tiles_added
    ```
    - The above code defines a function named "place_tiles" that takes one argument "tiles", which is a list of tuples representing the positions of the planes to be added.
    - The function uses a for loop to iterate through the list of tuples "tiles", and for each tuple, adds a plane mesh to the selected object at the specified position, rotates and scales the resulting plane, and returns the number of planes added.
    - The function then returns the number of planes added
    - The "place_tiles" function is then called with the argument tiles, which is a list of tuples representing the positions of the planes to be added.
    - The function uses a for loop to iterate through the list of tuples, and for each tuple, it uses the "mesh" operator to create a new mesh object and adds a plane to it.
    - The resulting plane is then rotated 90 degrees around the Z-axis, facing the x-axis, and then scaled up along the x-axis and z-axis.
    - The resulting plane is then placed at the specified location (x, y, -1) in the current object using the "mesh" operator.
    - The function then returns the number of planes added
    - The "place_tiles" function is then called with the argument tiles, which is a list of tuples representing the positions of the planes to be added.
    - The function uses a for loop to iterate through the list of tuples, and for each tuple, it uses the "mesh" operator to create a new mesh object and adds a plane to it.
    - The resulting plane is then rotated 90 degrees around the Z-axis, facing the x-axis, and then scaled up along the x-axis and z-axis.
    - The resulting plane is then placed at the specified location (x, y, -1) in the current object using the "mesh" operator.
    - The function then returns the number of planes added
