# add_tiles

    Purpose

    This function iterates over the cells in a game board (in this case, a 2x2 grid) and adds tiles to the board if the cell is empty.
    It does this by iterating through the cells, checking if they are empty, and if so, placing a tile on them.
    The function also keeps track of which cells have been visited and skips over cells that have already been visited.
    The function then takes in a cell_map argument which is a nested list representing the game board.
    ```python
    def add_tiles(cell_map):
        matrix_size = WIDTH
        for i in range(matrix_size**2):
            y = math.floor(i / matrix_size)
            x = i - y * matrix_size
            if cell_map[y][x] is False:  # cells with value True get cubes placed on them
                place_tile(x*2, y*2)
                visited.append((x*2, y*2))
        ```
        This function takes in a cell_map parameter, which is a nested list representing the game board.
        It then iterates over all of the cells in the board and checks if they are empty. If they are, it places a tile on them.
    The function also keeps track of which cells have been visited and skips over cells that have already been visited.
    ```python
    def add_tiles(cell_map):
        matrix_size = WIDTH
        for i in range(matrix_size**2):
            y = math.floor(i / matrix_size)
            x = i - y * matrix_size
            if cell_map[y][x] is False:  # cells with value True get cubes placed on them
                place_tile(x*2, y*2)
                visited.append((x*2, y*2))
    ```
    This function takes in a cell_map parameter, which is a nested list representing the game board.
    It then iterates over all of the cells in the board and checks if they are empty. If they are, it places a tile on them.
    The function also keeps track of which cells have been visited and skips over cells that have already been visited.
    This function is a recursive function that calculates the path to any given location and then calls itself with the next location in the path until the final location is reached.
    It keeps track of which cells have been visited and skips over cells that have already been visited.
    It also takes in a visited list, which is used to keep track of which cells have already been visited.
    It then takes in a cell_map parameter, which is a nested list representing the game board.
    It then iterates over all of the cells in the board and checks if they are empty. If they are, it places a tile on them.
    The function also keeps track of which cells have been visited and skips over cells that have already been visited.
    ```python
    def add_tiles(cell_map):
    matrix_size = WIDTH
    for i in range(matrix_size**2):
        y = math.floor(i / matrix_size)
        x = i - y * matrix_size
        if cell_map[y][x] is False:  # cells with value True get cubes placed on them
            place_tile(x*2, y*2)
            visited.append((x*2, y*2))
```
            This function iterates over the cells in a game board (in this case, a 2x2 grid) and adds tiles to the board if the cell is empty.
    It does this by iterating through the cells, checking if they are empty, and if so, placing a tile on them.
