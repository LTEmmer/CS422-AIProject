# clear_scene

    Purpose

    This Python function was designed to remove all of the objects in the "Scene" Object Mode, selecting them and deleting them, so that each frame has a unique set of objects.
    This function can be used for any scene you want to recreate, and it's flexible enough to work with any number of objects.
    It's especially useful for automating tasks like deleting objects when creating new scenes, or when you want to start over with a fresh slate.
    Additionally, this function can be used to recreate a new "Scene" in Blender's "Sequencer" mode, so you can create new scenes with unique objects each frame.
    In general, it's a useful tool for cleaning up and starting fresh, or creating a new scene with fresh objects each frame.
    By using this function in your script, you can recreate a new "Scene" in any given frame, and delete any objects you don't need.
    By deleting unnecessary objects, you can simplify your scenes and save on processing power.
    By using this function in Blender's Sequencer mode, you can recreate new "Scene" objects each frame, and delete any old ones if you don't need them.
    This function is very useful for automating tasks like creating new scenes with unique objects for each frame, or cleaning up scenes that you've created in Blender's Sequencer mode.
    It's a handy tool for developers and anyone who needs to recreate new scenes or delete old ones, and it can be used in any script you write.
    In Blender's Sequencer mode, you can also use this function to recreate "Scene" objects in the main "Scene" of your scene.
    This is useful for automating tasks like deleting any old "Scene" objects in your scene when you start over with a fresh slate, or when you want to create a new "Scene" in the Sequencer mode.
    The function is very useful for automating tasks like deleting any old "Scene" objects in your scene when you start over with a fresh slate, or when you want to create a new "Scene" in the Sequencer mode.
