# move_back

    Purpose

    """
"""
Purpose:
The purpose of the move_back function in the provided code is to update the player's position and direction based on the actions performed by the player. 
It is designed to simulate the movement of a player character in a game, such as Pac-Man.
"""
"""
Functionality:
The move_back function performs the following actions:

Reads the top direction from the direction_stack list.
Calculates the new position based on the y_pos and x_pos values, considering the player's current direction and the player's movement distance.
Updates the player's position accordingly.
Updates the player's direction based on the top direction in the direction_stack list.
Moves the player back in the direction determined by the top direction in the direction_stack list.
Repeats this process until all directions are consumed and the player reaches the start position.
"""
"""
Parameters:
None
"""
"""
Return Type:
None
"""
"""
Complexity:
O(N) where N is the number of directions in the direction_stack list. This complexity is O(1) as directions are processed in a loop, with no nested loops.
"""
"""
Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the move_back function is O(N), where N is the number of directions in the direction_stack list. This is because the function iterates over each direction in the stack, performing O(1) operations for each iteration.
"""
"""
Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the move_back function is O(N), where N is the number of directions in the direction_stack list. This is because the function uses a list in memory for the direction_stack and a set to keep track of the directions already processed.
