# index

    Purpose

    The code calculates the index of a grid in a 2D grid, given the x and y coordinates.
    The code has a function def index(x, y): parameter for x and y, and an if statement that returns None if x or y is negative, or x or y is out of bounds, otherwise it returns the x + y * cols.
    The code also has a constant variable rows = 8, cols = 8, and a constant variable cols = 8.
    The function has a def for x and y, a return for x + y * cols, and an else statement for None.
    The code has a def for x and y, a return for x + y * cols, and an else statement for None.
    The code has a def for x and y, a return for x + y * cols, and an else statement for None.
