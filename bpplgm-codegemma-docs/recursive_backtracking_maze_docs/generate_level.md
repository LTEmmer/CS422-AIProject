# generate_level

    Purpose

    This code is an implementation of a maze generation algorithm. The user can click on a cell on the mesh and
    the code will generate a new maze at a user specified level. The cell_array is a list of all the cells in the maze. The
    user has the option to click on a cell in the maze and the code will check if it is a valid move or if the user has won.
    The maze can be solved by clicking on a cell in the maze until all cells have been visited. The user will be notified of
    if the user has won or lost.
