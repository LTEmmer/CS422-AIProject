# perform_game_of_life_iteration

    Purpose

    Purpose of this function:
    The purpose of this function is to simulate the game of life using 2D arrays. It takes in an array of boolean values as an argument, representing the current state of each cell in the game. The function then creates a new array that represents the next state of each cell in the game.

    Inside the function, a variable named new_map is created to store the next state of each cell. The function then iterates through each cell in the old_map array and determines the number of live neighbors that each cell has. Based on the rules of Conway's game of life, the function then updates the new_map array accordingly.

    Finally, the function returns the updated new_map array as the next state of each cell in the game.

    ```python
    def perform_game_of_life_iteration(old_map):
    new_map = [[False for i in range(WIDTH)] for j in range(HEIGHT)]
    # Loop over each row and column of the level_map
    for x in range(len(old_map)):
        for y in range(len(old_map[0])):
            live_neighbor_count = count_alive_neighbors(old_map, x, y)

            if old_map[x][y] is True:
                # See if it should die and become open
                if live_neighbor_count < DEATH_LIMIT:
                    new_map[x][y] = False
                # Otherwise keep it as a wall
                else:
                    new_map[x][y] = True
            # If the tile is currently empty
            else:
                # See if it should become a wall
