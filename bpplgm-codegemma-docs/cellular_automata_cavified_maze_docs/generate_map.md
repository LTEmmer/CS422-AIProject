# generate_map

    Purpose

    This function is used to generate a map of the game of life, i.e. what cells are alive or dead. 
    
    It is used to create a map of the game of life, i.e. what cells are alive or dead.
    
    It performs a single iteration of the game of life and returns a new version of the map.
    
    It takes in a map, and returns a new map with the updated values.
    
    It takes in a map, and returns a new map with the updated values.
    
    It is used to perform a single iteration of the game of life and return a new version of the map.

    Parameters

    The documentation should be complete and succinct.
    Keep the documentation short but precise, and don't do a lengthy explanation of the function

    ## Implementation:
    
    ### GenerateMap
    ```
    def generate_map(cellmap):
        """
        Generates a new map based on the cellmap passed in
        and returns a new version of the map.
        """
        newmap = cellmap.copy()
        for i in range(len(cellmap)):
            for j in range(len(cellmap[i])):
                newmap[i][j] = calculate_cell(cellmap, i, j)
        return newmap
    ```
    
    ### CalculateCell
    ```
    def calculate_cell(cellmap, i, j):
        """
        Calculates the next state of a cell given its current state and the state of its adjacent cells.
        """
        alive = 0
        for i in range(i-1, i+2):
            for j in range(j-1, j+2):

                    continue
                if i == len(cellmap) or j == len(cellmap[i]):
                    continue
                if cellmap[i][j] == 1:

    Basic usage:


    Code:

    import generate_map

    with open('test_data.json', 'r') as f:
        data = json.load(f)

    generated_map = generate_map.generate_map(data)

    print(generated_map)
    ```

    Edge case:


    Code:

    import generate_map

    with open('test_data.json', 'r') as f:
        data = json.load(f)

    generated_map = generate_map.generate_map(data)

    print(generated_map)
    ```

    Advanced scenario (if applicable):


    Code:

    import generate_map

    with open('test_data.json', 'r') as f:
        data = json.load(f)

    generated_map = generate_map.generate_map(data)

    print(generated_map)
    ```

    Edge case:


    Code:

    import generate_map

    with open('test_data.json', 'r') as f:
        data = json.load(f)

    generated_map = generate_map.generate_map(data)

    print(generated_map)
    ```
