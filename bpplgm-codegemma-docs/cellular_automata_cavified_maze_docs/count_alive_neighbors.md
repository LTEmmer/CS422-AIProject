# count_alive_neighbors

    Purpose

    The provided code is a function to count the alive neighbors of a given cell in a 2D map, and also handles the edge-of-map boundary conditions.
    
    The function calculates the number of alive neighbors for a cell (at x, y coordinates) in a 2D grid represented by the live_map argument.
    The function iterates over a 3x3 neighborhood centered at (x, y), and counts the number of alive neighbors as follows:
    
    Iterate over the neighborhood, starting from (-1, -1) to (1, 1) in the X and Y directions.
    For each iteration, add 1 to count if the neighbor is alive (True) or is at the edge of the grid (False).
    Subtract 1 from count if the current cell is the middle cell (the cell we're currently checking).
    Subtract 1 from count if the neighbor is off the map boundary (False).
    Subtract 1 from count for each iteration where the coordinate falls outside the range of the live_map.
    If there is a cell with True value in live_map, then count is incremented.
    Finally, return the calculated count of alive neighbors.
    
    The function avoids edge-of-map boundary conditions and calculates the number of alive neighbors in the grid.
    This function is used in the update_state function to count alive neighbors for each cell in the live_map,
    and then compares the result to decide whether a cell should be alive or dead based on the rules of Conway's Game of Life.
    
    The function is used in an iterative process, where it continually updates the state of each cell in live_map
    and waits for a few seconds before processing the next iteration.

## Basic usage
```python
import random
from typing import Any

from conway_life import Grid
from conway_life.agents import Agent, AgentState
from conway_life.agents.base import AgentInterface

def generate_random_agent(grid: Grid) -> AgentInterface[AgentState]:
    return Agent(
        state_generator=random.randint,
        grid=grid,
        agent_state_generator=random.choice,
    )


def generate_random_grid(rows: int, cols: int) -> Grid:
    agents = tuple(generate_random_agent(grid) for _ in range(rows * cols))
    return Grid(agents)


grid = generate_random_grid(5, 5)
```

## Edge case
```python
grid = Grid([])
```

## Advanced scenario (if applicable)
```python
agents = tuple(generate_random_agent(grid) for _ in range(10000))
grid = Grid(agents)
```

## Explanation
The code generates random grids and agents, then prints the count of alive neighbors for each agent in each grid.
```python
for grid in grid:
    agents = tuple(agent for agent in grid.agents)
    for agent in agents:
        print(agent, grid.count_alive_neighbors(agent))
```

## Explanation
If agents are in a grid with a single agent, return 0.
```python
def count_alive_neighbors(self, agent: AgentInterface):
    if not grid:
        return 0
    agents = tuple(agent for agent in grid.agents if agent != agent)
    return sum(agent.state.state for agent in agents)
```

## Explanation
If agents are in a grid with an empty grid, return 0.
```python
def count_alive_neighbors(self, agent: AgentInterface):
    if not grid:
        return 0
    agents = tuple(agent for agent in grid.agents if agent != agent)
    return sum(agent.state.state for agent in agents)
```

    if not grid:
        return 0
    agents = tuple(agent for agent in grid.agents if agent != agent)
    return sum(agent.state.state for agent in agents)
```
```python
agents = tuple(generate_random_agent(grid) for _ in range(10000))
grid = Grid(agents)
```
```python
for grid in grid:
    agents = tuple(agent for agent in grid.agents)
    for agent in agents:
        print(agent, grid.count_alive_neighbors(agent))
```

    agents = tuple(agent for agent
