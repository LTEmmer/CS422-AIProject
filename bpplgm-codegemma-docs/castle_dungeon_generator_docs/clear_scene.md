    Examples

    Basic usage
Clear scene with all layers in a scene and with all layers in a scene

Example code:
```python
scene.clear_scene(all_layers=True)
```

Explanation:
- **Clear Scene**: Clears all layers in a scene, including all layers in a scene.
- **all_layers=True**: Clears all layers in the scene.

Example output:
```python
print("Cleared all layers in the scene.")
```

Edge case
Clear scene with no layers in a scene

Example code:
```python
scene.clear_scene(all_layers=True)
```

Explanation:
- **Clear Scene**: Clears all layers in a scene, including all layers in a scene.
- **all_layers=True**: Clears all layers in the scene.

Example output:
```python
print("Cleared all layers in the scene.")
```

Advanced scenario (if applicable)
Clear scene with layers in a scene

Example code:
```python
scene.clear_scene(all_layers=False)
```

Explanation:
- **Clear Scene**: Clears all layers in a scene, including all layers in a scene.
- **all_layers=True**: Clears all layers in the scene.

Example output:
```python
print("Cleared all layers in the scene.")
```

Edge case
Clear scene with no layers in a scene

Example code:
```python
scene.clear_scene(all_layers=False)
```
