# connect_rooms

    Purpose

    This function connects two rooms by updating their coordinates and connecting them if they are not already connected.
        The code uses the `get_random_int` function to generate random integers and sets the coordinates of the rooms randomly.
        The code also sets the `t` key in the room dictionary to 1, representing a room tile.
        The code then iterates through the rooms and connects them if their coordinates are not equal.
        It also adds rooms to the `connected` list if they are connected.
        The code then connects rooms `room` and `closest_room` if they are not already connected.

        The code also checks if the `should_connect` argument is True and if the rooms are connected, if they are not already connected.
        If they are connected, the code sets the `connected` attribute to True for both rooms.

        The code also adds rooms to the `connected` list if they are connected.

        Finally, the code returns the `connected` list of rooms.
