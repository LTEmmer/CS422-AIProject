# find_closest

    Purpose

    The function is calculating the average distance between the room and its closest neighbour.
        It does this by creating a master room variable which is the average of the room's x and y coordinates,
        then iterating through all rooms, subtracting the average room x and y coordinates from the comparison room x and y coordinates,
        adding the distances together and dividing by 2.
        It then subtracts the average room x and y coordinates from the comparison room x and y coordinates and adds the distances together,
        dividing by 2.
        It then iterates through all rooms again, subtracting the room x and y coordinates from the master room x and y coordinates,
        adding the distances together and dividing by 2.
        It then subtracts the room x and y coordinates from the master room x and y coordinates and adds the distances together,
        dividing by 2.
        It then returns the closest room or None.
        It is doing this in a nested for loop, and is looping through all rooms again, subtracting the room x and y coordinates from the master room x and y coordinates,
        adding the distances together and dividing by 2.
        It then subtracts the room x and y coordinates from the master room x and y coordinates and adds the distances together,
        dividing by 2.
        It then iterates through all rooms again, subtracting the room x and y coordinates from the master room x and y coordinates,

        It then subtracts the room x and y coordinates from the master room x and y coordinates and adds the distances together,
        dividing by 2.
        It then returns the closest room or None.

    Make each example short and concise.
    Be specific and meaningful in the code.

    Keep each example in a separate file.
    Make a comment at the top explaining the purpose of each example.
    In some cases, use comments to explain parts of the code that are more complex.
    For example, explain why a for loop is used to iterate over a list and not a generator.
    For example, explain why a generator is used instead of a for loop.
    For example, explain why a set is used instead of a list or dictionary.
