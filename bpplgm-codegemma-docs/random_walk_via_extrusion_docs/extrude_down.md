# extrude_down

    Purpose

    The extrude_down function takes an argument y_move_distance, which represents the distance in the y-direction from the starting position to extrude the down-facing cube.
    
    The extrude_down function then uses the extrude(start_x, start_y, start_z) function to extrude the cube down-facing, starting at the starting position (0, 0, 0).
    
    The extrude_down function then moves the cube down the extrude distance, subtracting the extrude distance from the starting position in the y-direction.
    
    The extrude_down function then uses the extrude(end_x, end_y, end_z) function to extrude the cube down-facing, starting at the new position (0, -y_move_distance, 0).
    
    The extrude_down function then moves the cube down the extrude distance, subtracting the extrude distance from the new position in the y-direction.
    
    The extrude_down function then extrudes the cube down-facing, starting at the new position, and ends at the starting position.
    
    The extrude_down function then extrudes the cube down-facing, starting at the starting position, and ends at the new position.

Basic usage:
```python
import bpy
from mathutils import Vector

# Explanation
Draw a line down from origin to (1,2,3).

bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cylinder_add(location=(0, 0, 0), radius=0.5, depth=2.5, enter_editmode=False, align='WORLD', 
    location=(0, 0, 0), scale=(1, 1, 1))

bpy.ops.mesh.extrude_down(TRANSFORM_OT_center_custom_axis={'Vector':(0,0,0), 'SCALE':(1,1,1), 'custom_axis':(0,0,1)})
```

Edge case:
```python
import bpy
from mathutils import Vector

# Explanation
Draw a line down from origin to (1,2,3).

bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cylinder_add(location=(0, 0, 0), radius=0.5, depth=2.5, enter_editmode=False, align='WORLD', 
    location=(0, 0, 0), scale=(1, 1, 1))

bpy.ops.mesh.extrude_down(TRANSFORM_OT_center_custom_axis={'Vector':(0,0,0), 'SCALE':(1,1,1), 'custom_axis':(0,0,1)})
```

Advanced scenario (if applicable):
```python
import bpy
from mathutils import Vector

# Explanation
Draw a line down from origin to (1,2,3).

bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cylinder_add(location=(0, 0, 0), radius=0.5, depth=2.5, enter_editmode=False, align='WORLD', 
    location=(0, 0, 0), scale=(1, 1, 1))

bpy.ops.mesh.extrude_down(TRANSFORM_OT_center_custom_axis={'Vector':(0,0,0), 'SCALE':(1,1,1), 'custom_axis':(0,0,1)})
```

This script draws a line down from origin to (1,2,3). It does so by extruding a cylinder of radius 0.5, depth 2.5, and a height of 1.
```python
import bpy
from mathutils import Vector

# Explanation
Draw a line down from origin to (1,2,3).

bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cylinder_add(location=(0, 0, 0), radius=0.5, depth=2.5, enter_editmode=False, align='WORLD', 
    location=(0, 0, 0), scale=(1, 1, 1))

bpy.ops.mesh.extrude_down(TRANSFORM_OT_center_custom_axis={'Vector':(0,0,0), 'SCALE':(1,1,1), 'custom_axis':(0,0,1)})
