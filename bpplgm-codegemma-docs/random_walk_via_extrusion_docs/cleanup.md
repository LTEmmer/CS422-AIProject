# cleanup

    Purpose

    ## Function Purpose ##
    This function is used to cleanup a mesh in Blender and remove any duplicate vertices and faces. It is called by the user after the mesh is loaded and ready to be cleaned up.
    ## Function Code ##
    ```python
    def cleanup():
    """
    Cleanup a mesh in Blender and remove any duplicate vertices and faces.

    :return: None
    """
    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='EDIT')
    bpy.ops.mesh.select_all(action='SELECT')
    bpy.ops.mesh.remove_doubles()
    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')
    ```
    ## Function Details ##
    - This function takes no arguments and returns no values.
    - It operates on the selected object in the active object mode.
    - It removes any duplicate vertices from the selected object and faces from the selected faces.
    - Blender is a popular tool for generating and rendering 3D art. The user can edit, render, and export mesh data in Blender.
    - This function is used to clean up a mesh in Blender and remove any duplicate vertices and faces.
    ## Function Usage ##
    1. Load a mesh in Blender.
    2. Select the mesh you want to clean up.
    3. Run the cleanup function.
    4. The selected mesh will be cleaned up and any duplicate vertices and faces removed.
    ## Function Limitations ##
    1. Blender is a free software tool.
    2. Blender requires a license to use.
    3. Blender requires a license to run in production.
    4. Blender is a slow processing tool.
    5. Blender is a mobile operating system.
    ## Function Future Work ##
    1. Blender allows users to import meshes from various file formats, including OBJ, STL, and STL.
    2. Blender allows users to export meshes in various file formats, including OBJ, STL, and STL.
    3. Blender allows users to import meshes from various file formats, including OBJ, STL, and STL.
    4. Blender allows users to export meshes in various file formats, including OBJ, STL, and STL.
    ## Conclusion ##
    This function is used to clean up a mesh in Blender and remove any duplicate vertices and faces. Blender is a popular tool for generating and rendering 3D art. The user can edit, render, and export mesh data in Blender.
    ## Disclaimer ##
    This function is not foolproof and should be used with caution.
