# extrude_right

    Purpose

    The purpose of the extrude_right function is to extrude the given x_move_distance from the x-axis and rotate the z-axis
    by 90 degrees to the left. This function is called by extrude_cubes and is used as follows:
    ```python
    extrude_right(1.0)
    ```
    This call to extrude_right will extrude a cube with a length of 1.0 units and rotate it to the left 90 degrees, while leaving
    the z-axis in its original orientation.
    The extrude_cubes function extrudes cubes and calls extrude_right to extrude them in a loop in a given direction.
    It is called by extrude_cubes and is used as follows:
    ```python
    extrude_cubes(1, 1.0, False)
    ```
    This call to extrude_cubes will extrude a cube with a length of 1.0 units in the given direction, and rotate the z-axis
    by 90 degrees in the given direction. The direction is specified by the parameter forward, which is set to True by default.
    ```python
    ```
    The extrude_cubes function extrudes cubes, extrudes them in a loop, and then extrudes cubes in the opposite direction.
    It is called by extrude_cubes and is used as follows:
    ```python
    extrude_cubes(1, 1.0, True)
    ```
    This call to extrude_cubes will extrude a cube with a length of 1.0 units in the forward direction, extrude the
    cubes in the forward direction, extrude the cubes in the opposite direction, and extrude the cubes in the reverse
    direction.
    The extrude_cubes function has three parameters:
    - cube_count: The number of cubes to extrude.
    - cube_length: The length of each cube.
    - forward: A boolean value that specifies the direction of extrusion. If forward is True, extrude_cubes will extrude cubes
    in the forward direction, and if forward is False, extrude_cubes will extrude cubes in the reverse direction.
    ```python
    ```
    The extrude_cubes function is called by extrude_right and extrude_cubes and is used to extrude cubes in a given direction.
    It is called by extrude_right and extrude_cubes and is used as follows:
    ```python
    extrude_cubes(1, 1.0, False)
    ```

    ```python
    ```
