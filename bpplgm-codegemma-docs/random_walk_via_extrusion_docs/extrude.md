# extrude

    Purpose

    It is a function that extrudes a cube (called extrude) into a shape. 
            The cube is defined by the x, y, and z parameters, which are the coordinates of the center of the cube.
            It extrudes the cube from its bottom edge and extends it up to z units.
            
            It is called extrude because it is a function that extrudes (creates) a cube.
            The function extrude takes three parameters: x, y, and z, which are the coordinates of the center of the cube.
            The function extrude then extrudes a cube from its bottom edge and extends it up to z units.

            The cube is defined by its bottom edge, which is defined by the coordinates (0, 0, 0) and (1, 1, 1).
            The cube is then positioned in the x, y, and z coordinates using extrude.
            The extrude function takes in a set of vertices, a set of faces, and a set of edges, and then extrudes the cube.

            The vertices are defined by the coordinates (0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1), (1, 0, 0), and (1, 1, 0).
            The faces are defined by the indices of the vertices in the order of counterclockwise winding.
            The faces are then used to create a set of edges for each face.
            The edges are defined by the indices of the vertices in the order of counterclockwise winding.
            
            The extrude function then extrudes the cube by extruding from its bottom edge up to z units.

    ### Basic Usage
    ```python
    import bpy
    from bpy_extras.object_utils import world_to_local
    from mathutils import Vector

    def extrude(origin, delta, angle, extrude_verts):
        # Calculate the rotated delta vector
        rotated_delta = delta.rotate(origin)

        # Calculate the vertices of the extruded polygon
        extruded_vertices = []
        for i in range(len(extrude_verts)):
            rotated_vert = extrude_verts[i].rotate(origin)
            rotated_vert = rotated_vert.rotate(rotated_delta)
            extruded_vertices.append(rotated_vert)

        # Create a new object to represent the extruded polygon
        bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_polygon_add(vertices=extruded_vertices)
        extruded_object = bpy.context.selected_objects[0]

        # Set the extrude_verts as the vertices of the extruded polygon
        extruded_object.data.vertices = extruded_vertices

        return extruded_object

    # Example usage
    origin = Vector((0, 0, 0))
    delta = Vector((1, 0, 0))
    angle = 45
    extrude_verts = [Vector((1, 1, 0)), Vector((0, 0, 1)), Vector((1, 0, 0))]

    extruded_object = extrude(origin, delta, angle, extrude_verts)
    extruded_object.name = "Extruded Polygon"
