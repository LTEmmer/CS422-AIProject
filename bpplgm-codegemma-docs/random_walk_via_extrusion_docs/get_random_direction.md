# get_random_direction

    Purpose

    - The purpose of this function is to generate a random direction using a dictionary and a random integer.
    - It takes no arguments, except for a global variable 'direction' which is defined and initialized in the function.
    - The function returns a random direction ('up', 'right', 'down', or 'left') using a random integer as an index into a dictionary.
    - It uses a global variable 'direction' to store the mapping of directions to their corresponding values (for easy access) rather than creating a new dictionary for each call.
    - The function utilizes the Python random module for generating random integers.
    - The dictionary mapping directions is defined globally, making it accessible throughout the function.
    - The random integer is generated using random.randint(0, 3), resulting in a random index into the direction list.
    - The function returns the mapped direction using the randomly generated index.
    - The code is designed to generate a random direction for use in game logic, making it useful in creating a randomized path for a snake.
