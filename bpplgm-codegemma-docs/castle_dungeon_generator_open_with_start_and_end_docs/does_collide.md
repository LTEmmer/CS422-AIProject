# does_collide

    Purpose

    This function takes in a `room` dictionary and checks if there is a collision between the rooms.
    It compares each room in the `rooms` list with the given room and determines if there is a collision between them.
    If a collision is detected, the function returns `True`, indicating a collision has occurred.
    If no collision is found, the function returns `False`, indicating no collision has occurred.

    This function is a collision detection function used in the Game class to check if any walls or other
    objects are colliding with each other or with the player's own position.
    It takes in a `room` dictionary representing a specific room and compares it with a list of rooms
    and checks if there is a collision between them.
    If a collision is detected, the function returns `True`, indicating a collision has occurred.
    If no collision is found, the function returns `False`, indicating no collision has occurred.
    This function is used in the Game class to check if any walls or other objects are colliding with each other
    or with the player's own position.
