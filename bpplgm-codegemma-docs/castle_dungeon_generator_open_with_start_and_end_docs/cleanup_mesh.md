    ### Example 1: Basic usage
    ```python
    """
    >>> cleanup_mesh(mesh)
    """
    ```

    ### Example 2: Edge case
    ```python
    """
    >>> cleanup_mesh(mesh, cull_faces_with_less_than=2)
    """
    ```

    ### Example 3: Advanced scenario (if applicable)
    ```python
    """
    >>> cleanup_mesh(mesh, cull_faces_with_less_than=2, cull_vertices_with_less_than=3)
    """
    ```

    ### Example 4: Advanced scenario (if applicable)
    ```python
    """
    >>> cleanup_mesh(mesh, cull_faces_with_less_than=2, cull_vertices_with_less_than=3, cull_edges_with_less_than=5)
    """
    ```

    ### Example 5: Advanced scenario (if applicable)
    ```python
    """
    >>> cleanup_mesh(mesh, cull_faces_with_less_than=2, cull_vertices_with_less_than=3, cull_edges_with_less_than=5, cull_vertices_with_less_than=10)
    """
    ```

    ### Example 6: Advanced scenario (if applicable)
    ```python
