# find_farthest

    Purpose

    The function find_farthest() takes an instance of a Game class (not a reference) and modifies its instance variables (modifying state) to record the distance from farthest rooms in each direction and the rooms themselves.
    This function is intended to be used in an algorithm for analyzing the room relationships in a dungeon.
    It finds rooms in which all other rooms are less than 100px apart.
    It modifies Game.rooms to record which rooms are farthest from eachother.
    It modifies Game.first_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the east direction.
    It modifies Game.first_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the north direction.
    It modifies Game.last_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the west direction.
    It modifies Game.last_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the south direction.
    It modifies Game.first_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the east direction, and Game.last_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the west direction.
    It modifies Game.first_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the north direction, and Game.last_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the south direction.
    It modifies Game.first_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the east direction, Game.last_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the west direction, and Game.mid_point_room to record the mid_point_room.
    It modifies Game.first_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the north direction, Game.last_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the south direction, Game.mid_point_room to record the mid_point_room, and Game.mid_point_room to record the mid_point_room.
    It modifies Game.first_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the east direction, Game.last_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the west direction, Game.mid_point_room to record the mid_point_room, and Game.mid_point_room to record the mid_point_room.
    It modifies Game.first_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the north direction, Game.last_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the south direction, Game.mid_point_room to record the mid_point_room, and Game.mid_point_room to record the mid_point_room.
    It modifies Game.first_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the east direction, Game.last_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the west direction, Game.mid_point_room to record the mid_point_room, and Game.mid_point_room to record the mid_point_room.
    It modifies Game.first_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the north direction, Game.last_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the south direction, Game.mid_point_room to record the mid_point_room, and Game.mid_point_room to record the mid_point_room.
    It modifies Game.first_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the east direction, Game.last_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the west direction, Game.mid_point_room to record the mid_point_room, and Game.mid_point_room to record the mid_point_room.
    It modifies Game.first_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the north direction, Game.last_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the south direction, Game.mid_point_room to record the mid_point_room, and Game.mid_point_room to record the mid_point_room.
    It modifies Game.first_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the east direction, Game.last_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the west direction, Game.mid_point_room to record the mid_point_room, and Game.mid_point_room to record the mid_point_room.
    It modifies Game.first_room to record the farthest room in Game.rooms in the north direction, Game.last_room to record the farthest roo
