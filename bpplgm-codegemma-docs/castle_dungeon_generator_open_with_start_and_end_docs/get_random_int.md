# get_random_int

    Purpose

    **High Level Description:**
        The function `get_random_int(low, high)` returns a random integer between `low` and `high`, not including the
        `high` value. The function uses the Python module `random` to generate a random float between `0` and `1`,
        multiplies it by the difference between `low` and `high`, and then adds `low`. The result is then rounded to the
        nearest integer, and is returned as an integer.
    **Low Level Description:**
        The `get_random_int(low, high)` function uses a random float between `0` and `1` to generate a random number
        between `low` and `high`, then subtracts `low` from the result to obtain a random integer between `low` and
        `high`, then adds `low` to the result to obtain a random integer between `low` and `high`, and rounds the result
        to the nearest integer.
    
    **Functionality:**
        The `get_random_int(low, high)` function generates a random integer between `low` and `high` and returns it,
        without any error handling or validation. The function is a simple example of pseudo-randomness and is not
        suitable for production use.

    **Pseudo-Randomness:**
        The function uses a random float between `0` and `1` to generate a random number between `low` and `high`,
        then subtracts `low` from the result to obtain a random integer between `low` and `high`, then adds `low` to the
        result to obtain a random integer between `low` and `high`, and rounds the result to the nearest integer. The
        resulting random integer is then returned as the function's output.

    **Validation:**
        The function does not validate its input parameters. The input parameters must be integers and `low` must be less
        than or equal to `high`. The function simply generates a random float between `0` and `1`, multiplies it by the
        difference between `low` and `high`, then adds `low` to the result. The result is then rounded to the nearest
        integer, and is returned as an integer.

    **Safety:**
        The function does not handle input parameters that are not integers. The input parameters must be integers and
        `low` must be less than or equal to `high`. The function simply generates a random float between `0` and `1`,
        multiplies it by the difference between `low` and `high`, then adds `low` to the result. The result is then rounded to
        the nearest integer, and is returned as an integer.
    
    **Security:**
        The function does not handle input parameters that are out of range. The input parameters must be integers and
        `low` must be less than or equal to `high`. The function simply generates a random float between `0` and `1`,
        multiplies it by the difference between `low` and `high`, then adds `low` to the result. The result is then rounded to
        the nearest integer, and is returned as an integer.
    
    **Consistency:**
        The function does not depend on any external data, such as a timestamp or a random seed. The function simply generates
        a random float between `0` and `1`, multiplies it by the difference between `low` and `high`, then adds `low` to the
        result. The result is then rounded to the nearest integer, and is returned as an integer.
    
    **Determinism:**
        The function is deterministic. The random float generated by `get_random_int(0, 1)` is fixed for a given input
        value of `low` and `high`. The function generates a random float between `0` and `1`, multiplies it by the
        difference between `low` and `high`, then adds `low` to the result. The result is then rounded to the nearest
        integer, and is returned as an integer.
    
    **Thread Safety:**
        The function is not thread safe. The function does not rely on any external synchronization mechanisms. The
        function simply generates a random float between `0` and `1`, multiplies it by the difference between `low` and `high`,
        then adds `low` to the result. The resul

    # Basic usage
    def get_random_int(min, max):
        """
        Generate a random integer between min and max (inclusive).
        """
        return random.randint(min, max)

    Explanation:
    The function generates a random integer between min and max (inclusive) using
    the random.randint function from the Python Standard Library. The function
    uses type annotations and descriptive variable names. The function returns a
    random integer between min and max (inclusive). The function has type
    annotations for min and max, which indicate that they must be integers.
    The function also includes a docstring explaining the purpose of the function,
    and a short explanation of how to use the function.
