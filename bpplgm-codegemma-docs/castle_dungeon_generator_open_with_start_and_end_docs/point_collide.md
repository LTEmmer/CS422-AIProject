# point_collide

    Purpose

    This function takes an x and y coordinate as input and returns True if a point at the given coordinates is a
    point on the map and False otherwise. The point_collide function is used in other Python files to check if a
    point on the map has already been touched.

    Do not offer suggestions, refactorings, or code improvements. Only describe the purpose of the code *as written*:
    This function takes a point (x, y) as input and returns True if the point is a point on the map and False otherwise.

    This function checks if a point is a point on the map and returns True if it is and False otherwise. It takes
    in an x and y coordinate and returns True if there is a point on the map at the given coordinates, False
    otherwise. The point_collide function is used in other Python files to check if a point on the map has already
    been touched.
