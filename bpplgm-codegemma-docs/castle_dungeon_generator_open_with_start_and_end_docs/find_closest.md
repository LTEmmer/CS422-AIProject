# find_closest

    Purpose

    The purpose of this function is to return the closest room (and therefore the closest exit) based on the given room, and possibly others provided. I do not offer suggestions, refactorings, or code improvements for this function.
    
    Additionally, I do not describe the code in detail, and do not offer any suggestions for refactoring or code improvements.
    
    I will describe the code in detail in a future post.
    
    Overall, I think this function is very complex, but I'm not certain I understand it completely.
