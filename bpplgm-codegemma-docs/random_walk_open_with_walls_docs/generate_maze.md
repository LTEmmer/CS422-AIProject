# generate_maze

    Purpose

    The purpose of this function is to generate a maze using the cellular automata method. This function contains a nested for loop, which iterates over ITERATIONS and generates a random direction for each iteration. The next_move function is called with the direction of the next move, which is a random direction from the four cardinal directions.
    
    The cleanup_mesh function is called after the maze has been generated and the walls have been built. This function performs some cleanup operations on the mesh, such as removing unused vertices and faces, and merging adjacent vertices.
    
    The build_walls function is also a nested for loop, which iterates over ITERATIONS and generates a random direction for each iteration. The direction is then used to create walls in the mesh.
    
    The get_random_direction function is used to generate a random direction for the next move. This function is called in the generate_maze function and iterates over ITERATIONS.
    
    The next_move function is a helper function that takes a direction as an argument and performs the appropriate move. This function is called in the generate_maze function and iterates over ITERATIONS.
    
    The generate_maze function is the main function of the program and is called to generate the maze. This function is called once, at the very beginning of the program.
