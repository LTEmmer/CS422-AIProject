# check_neighbors_and_place_wall

    Purpose

    - The given function is a recursive function that checks the neighbors of a given position,
      places walls if the neighbors are off-grid, and recursively checks the neighboring neighbors of the walls until
      all positions are visited.
    - The function has a parameter "pos" which is a tuple representing the current position to check.
    - The function first creates a list of tuples representing the offsets from the given position to the four neighbors.
    - It then iterates through the list of offsets and checks if each offset is in the visited list or in the walls list.
    - If an offset is not in either list, the function calls the place_cube function with the x and y coordinates of the offset.
    - The function then adds the offset tuple to the walls list if it has not been added yet.
    - The function then checks the neighbors of the walls list and calls the function recursively for each neighbor until all positions are visited.
    - The function has an additional parameter "visited" which is a list of tuples representing the positions that have already been visited.
    - The function also has an additional parameter "walls" which is a list of tuples representing the walls that have already been placed.
    - The function uses a list of offsets to iterate through all of the neighbors of a given position.
    - The function uses a list of offsets to iterate through all of the neighbors of a given position.
    - The function uses a list of offsets to iterate through all of the neighbors of a given position.

        Determine if placing a new wall (line) in a grid is possible.

        - **Input**: None
        - **Output**: True or False

        ## Algorithm

        1. **Initialize**:
            - `grid`: The grid where the new wall will be placed.
            - `wall_coordinates`: Coordinates of the new wall.

        2. **Check if Wall Overlaps**:
            - Iterate through the grid to check if the new wall will overlap with an existing wall.
            - Check if any of the four corners of the new wall coincide with any existing walls.
            - If any corner matches, return False (overlapping).

        3. **Check if Coordinates Valid**:
            - Ensure that the new wall coordinates are within the grid boundaries.
            - If they are outside the grid, return False (coordinates outside the grid).

        4. **Check if Coordinates Already Exists**:
            - Iterate through the grid to check if any of the new wall coordinates already exist.
            - If any match, return False (coordinates already used).

        5. **If All Tests Pass**:
            - If no overlapping or coordinates already used conditions are met, return True (wall can be placed).

        6. **If Any Test Fails**:
            - If any of the tests fail, return False (wall cannot be placed).

        ## Usage

        ```python
        grid = [
            [0, 0, 0, 0],
            [0, 0, 0, 0],
            [0, 0, 0, 0],
            [0, 0, 0, 0],
        ]
        wall_coordinates = (2, 3)

        if check_neighbors_and_place_wall():
            print("Wall placement is valid.")
        else:
            print("Wall placement is not valid.")
        ```

        ## Edge Case

        ```python
        grid = [
            [0, 0, 0, 0],
            [0, 0, 0, 0],
            [0, 0, 0, 0],
            [0, 0, 0, 0],
        ]
        wall_coordinates = (2, 5)
