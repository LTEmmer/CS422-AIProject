# cleanup_mesh

    Purpose

    ```
    Clean up Mesh
    Gets all cube objects and joins them into one cube.
```
    -This function is used to cleanup and prepare mesh objects for Blender. It gets all cube objects, joins them into one cube, jumps into edit mode, selects all verts, and removes overlapping verts.


    -This code has many lines of code that can be condensed into one line of code or into several lines of code. The code is also commented to explain what each line of code does.

    -This code has a for loop that iterates over each cube object in bpy.context.scene.objects. If the cube object's name starts with "Cube" and ends with "1", then the cube object is deleted.

    -This code has a while loop that continues until the total number of cube objects in bpy.context.scene.objects is zero. The loop deletes all cube objects in bpy.context.scene.objects.

    -This code has a print statement that prints the number of cube objects in bpy.context.scene.objects.

    -This code has a for loop that iterates over each cube object in bpy.context.scene.objects. The loop checks if the cube object is an instance of the bpy.types.Object class and if so, deletes it.
