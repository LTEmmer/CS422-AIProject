# build_walls

    Purpose

    Build walls to build a maze in Python.
    The code iterates through the visited list, and for each position, it calls a function to check its neighbors and place a wall if it is safe to do so.

    The purpose of the function is to build walls for the maze in Python.
    The code iterates through the visited list, and for each position, it calls a function to check its neighbors and place a wall if it is safe to do so.

    Examples

    Basic usage:
    ```python
    import build_walls
    build_walls.main(
        file_name="walls.txt",
        line_count=5,
        wall_length=5,
        wall_height=5,
        num_walls=5,
        num_walls_per_line=5,
    )
    ```
    ```
    Explanation:
    Generates a 5x5 grid of walls with 5 walls, each 5x5 blocks.
    ```
    ```python
    import build_walls
    build_walls.main(
        file_name="walls.txt",
        line_count=10,
        wall_length=10,
        wall_height=10,
        num_walls=10,
        num_walls_per_line=10,
    )
    ```
    ```
    Explanation:
    Generates a 10x10 grid of walls with 10 walls, each 10x10 blocks.
    ```

    Advanced scenario (if applicable):
    ```python
    import build_walls
