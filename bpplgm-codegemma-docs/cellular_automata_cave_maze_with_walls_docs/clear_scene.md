# clear_scene

    Purpose

    The `clear_scene()` function is used to clear the Blender scene for a new game.
    It clears all objects, selections, and layers in the Blender window.
    It can be used to prepare the Blender scene for a new game, making sure all objects are in the initial state.
    
    It uses the `bpy` library to access Blender functionalities.
    It uses the `bpy.ops.object.mode_set()` operator to switch to object mode.
    It uses the `bpy.ops.object.select_all()` operator to select all objects.
    It uses the `bpy.ops.object.delete()` operator to delete these objects.
    
    The `if` statement is used to check if the Blender object mode is in object mode.
    If it is, it proceeds with the clear operation.
    Otherwise, it prints an error message indicating that Blender is not in object mode.
    
    After the clear operation, it switches back to the object mode.
    It selects all objects again, deletes all of them, and then proceeds with the next part of the code.
    ```python
    import bpy
    def clear_scene():
    if bpy.ops.object.mode_set.poll():
        bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')
        bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')
        bpy.ops.object.delete(use_global=False)

    Basic usage
1. **Clear Scene:**
    - **Description:**
      - The purpose of this function is to clear a given scene by removing all its actors and scripts.
      - It's used to facilitate resetting a scene after gameplay has been completed.
    - **Code:**
      - ```python
        clear_scene(scene):
            scene.clear()
      ```
    - **Edge Case:**
      - The function should not result in an error if the given scene is None.
      - It's best to provide proper error handling for this scenario.
    - **Advanced Scenario:**
      - The function can potentially be extended with additional parameters if needed.
