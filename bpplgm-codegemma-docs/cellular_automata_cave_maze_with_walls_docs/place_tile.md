# place_tile

    Purpose

    1. The function is defining a function called `place_tile` that accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which represent the coordinates of a tile on a chessboard.
2. The function first creates a new `Plane` object in the current context using `bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_plane_add`. The plane is set to be 2 units in the x and y directions and located at the specified `(x, y, -1)` location.
3. The function then returns a reference to the newly created plane.
4. The `place_tile` function can be called with any valid coordinates for a tile on a chessboard, and it will create a new plane with a specified size and location.

This function is used to create planes for visual representations of tiles in a chessboard, and can be called by users who want to create planes for tiles on a chessboard in Blender.
