# check_neighbors_and_place_wall

    Purpose

    ```
    Function Purpose:
    The function checks the neighbors of a given position in a maze to see if there are any empty spaces, and if there are, it creates a wall between the current position and the empty space.

    Parameters:
    pos (tuple): The position of the cube in the maze, in the format (x, y).

    Returns:
    None.
    ```
    ```
    Algorithm:
    The function first creates an empty list called offset_map, which is used to store the offsets of the neighbors of the current position. The first element of offset_map is a tuple containing the x-coordinate of the cube 2.0 units to the left of the current position and the y-coordinate of the cube. 
    The second element of offset_map is a tuple containing the x-coordinate of the cube 2.0 units to the right of the current position and the y-coordinate of the cube.
    The third element of offset_map is a tuple containing the x-coordinate of the cube at the current position and the y-coordinate of the cube 2.0 units below the current position.
    The fourth element of offset_map is a tuple containing the x-coordinate of the cube at the current position and the y-coordinate of the cube 2.0 units above the current position.
    The function then loops through each element of offset_map and checks if the corresponding element is in the visited list or if the corresponding element is in the walls list. If it is not, the function calls the place_cube function with the x- and y-coordinates of the offset_tuple as parameters.
    The function then appends the offset_tuple to the walls list if it is not already in the list.
