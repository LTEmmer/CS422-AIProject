# cleanup_mesh

    Purpose

    *The function does not perform any actions or modify any meshes in the Blender environment*
    
    This code block performs several operations on a mesh in Blender using Blender's API. The function `cleanup_mesh` is a Python function that takes no input arguments and does not return any values. 

1. The function first selects all objects in the current scene using the `bpy.ops.object.select_all` operation. This operation selects all objects in the Blender environment, including any meshes or textures.
2. The next line defines an empty tuple `bpy.context.scene` which is used to access the current scene in Blender. The `context` is an important part of the Blender API that allows you to access the current state of the Blender environment.
3. The function then selects all objects in the current scene using the `bpy.ops.object.select_all` operation again. This operation selects all objects in the Blender environment, including any meshes or textures.
4. The function then joins all objects in the current scene into a single mesh using the `bpy.ops.object.join` operation. This operation joins all the selected objects into a single mesh, with the selected object being the parent of the new mesh.
5. The function then jumps into edit mode using the `bpy.ops.object.editmode_toggle` operation. Edit mode is a mode in Blender that allows you to modify the properties of objects and objects in the scene.
6. The function then selects all vertices in the current mesh using the `bpy.ops.mesh.select_all` operation. This operation selects all vertices in the current mesh.
7. The function then removes any duplicate vertices in the current mesh using the `bpy.ops.mesh.remove_doubles` operation. This operation removes any duplicate vertices in the current mesh, and creates a new mesh with unique vertices.
8. The function then jumps out of edit mode using the `bpy.ops.object.editmode_toggle` operation. Edit mode is a mode in Blender that allows you to modify the properties of objects and objects in the scene.
9. The function then selects all objects in the current scene using the `bpy.ops.object.select_all` operation again. This operation selects all objects in the Blender environment, including any meshes or textures.
10. The function then removes any duplicate vertices in the current mesh using the `bpy.ops.mesh.remove_doubles` operation again. This operation removes any duplicate vertices in the current mesh, and creates a new mesh with unique vertices.
11. The function then jumps into edit mode using the `bpy.ops.object.editmode_toggle` operation again. Edit mode is a mode in Blender that allows you to modify the properties of objects and objects in the scene.
12. The function then selects all vertices in the current mesh using the `bpy.ops.mesh.select_all` operation again. This operation selects all vertices in the current mesh.
13. The function then removes any duplicate vertices in the current mesh using the `bpy.ops.mesh.remove_doubles` operation again. This operation removes any duplicate vertices in the current mesh, and creates a new mesh with unique vertices.
14. The function then jumps out of edit mode using the `bpy.ops.object.editmode_toggle` operation. Edit mode is a mode in Blender that allows you to modify the properties of objects and objects in the scene.
15. The function then selects all objects in the current scene using the `bpy.ops.object.select_all` operation once again. This operation selects all objects in the Blender environment, including any meshes or textures.
16. The function then joins all objects in the current scene into a single mesh using the `bpy.ops.object.join` operation. This operation joins all the selected objects into a single mesh, with the se

    ### Basic Usage
    ```python
    def foo():
        # Explanation
        cleanup_mesh(mesh, lambda vertex, neighbors: ...)

    def cleanup_mesh(mesh, filter):
        """
        :param mesh: a mesh of Vertex objects
        :param filter: a function to be applied on all Vertex objects to determine if they should be cleaned up
        :return: a copy of the mesh with all Vertex objects cleaned up
        """
        def cleanup_vertex(v):
            if filter(v):
                v.name = None
                v.color = None
                v.normal = None
                v.uv = None

        cleaned_vertices = [v for v in mesh.vertices if cleanup_vertex(v)]
        cleaned_faces = [face for face in mesh.faces if face.vertices_count > 0]
        cleaned_mesh = Mesh(cleaned_vertices, cleaned_faces, None)

        return cleaned_mesh
    ```


    ### Edge Case

        :param filter: a function to be applied on all Vertex objects to determine if they should be cleaned up
        :return: a copy of the mesh with all Vertex objects cleaned up
        """
        def cleanup_vertex(v):
            if filter(v):
                v.name = None
                v.color = None
                v.normal = None
                v.uv = None

        cleaned_vertices = [v for v in mesh.vertices if cleanup_vertex(v)]
