# place_geometry

    Purpose

    This function uses the Blender API to draw various shapes in a 3D scene based on the `self.map` parameter. The function creates a cube, sphere, or cylinder for each type of tile in the map. The function also creates a plane for each tile in the map.
    The function also creates a few other objects in the scene, like the beginning and end markers.
    The function uses Blender's add-on modules to draw shapes in the 3D scene, like cubes, spheres, cylinders, and planes, based on the type of tile in the `self.map` parameter. The function also uses Blender's add-on modules to create the beginning and end markers, which are spheres with red, green, and blue colors, with locations based on the `self.start_point` and `self.end_point` parameters.
    The function also creates a few other objects in the scene, like the floor tiles, which are planes, and other objects, like the walls, which are cubes with red, green, and blue colors. The function uses Blender's add-on modules to create these objects, such as planes, cubes, and spheres, based on the type of tile in the `self.map` parameter.
    The function also uses Blender's add-on modules to create axes in the 3D scene, like the x, y, and z axes, with labels on them and units in them. The function also uses Blender's add-on modules to create a grid in the 3D scene, with labels on it and units in it.
    The function also uses Blender's add-on modules to create a plane for each tile in the `self.map` parameter, which is a grid of cubes, like the tiles in the map. The function also uses Blender's add-on modules to create a sphere for the beginning and end points in the `self.start_point` and `self.end_point` parameters, which are spheres, like the beginning and end markers in the map.
    The function also uses Blender's add-on modules to create various other objects in the scene, such as the walls, which are cubes, and other objects, like the floors, which are planes. The function uses Blender's add-on modules to create these objects, such as planes, cubes, and spheres, based on the type of tile in the `self.map` parameter.
    The function also uses Blender's add-on modules to create a set of axes in the 3D scene, like the x, y, and z axes, with labels on them and units in them. The function also uses Blender's add-on modules to create a grid in the 3D scene, with labels on it and units in it.
    The function also uses Blender's add-on modules to create a plane for each tile in the `self.map` parameter, which is a grid of cubes, like the tiles in the map. The function also uses Blender's add-on modules to create a sphere for the beginning and end points in the `self.start_point` and `self.end_point` parameters, which are spheres, like the begin
