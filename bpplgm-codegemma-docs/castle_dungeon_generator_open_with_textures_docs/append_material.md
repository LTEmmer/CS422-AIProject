# append_material

    Purpose

    - The function takes in a directory path, a file path, and a material name as parameters. It then appends a material by name to the scene, returning None.

    - The material name parameter is used to specify the material to be appended.

    - The directory parameter is used to specify the directory in which the material is to be located.

    - The filepath parameter is used to specify the file path in which the material is to be located.

    - The bpy module is used to access Blender-related functions.

    - The bpy.ops.wm.append function appends a material with the specified name to the Blender scene.

    - The function does not return any value, so None is returned.

    - The code snippet is provided in Python syntax, but the purpose of the function is not immediately apparent. The function is used to append a material to a Blender scene, but the code snippet does not provide any specific explanation of what the function does or why it is being used.

    - The code snippet is used to add a material to the Blender scene, which could be used to customize or modify the appearance of an object in Blender.

    - The function does not return a value, so None is returned.
