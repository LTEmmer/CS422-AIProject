# find_farthest

    Purpose

    """
"""
- Finds the farthest point in the room
- It calculates the distance between two points by subtracting one point's x, y from the other point's x, y.
- After it does this for every point, it will return the farthest point.
- I made the function take in a self object and iterate through the list of rooms and compare the midpoint of each room's x, y coordinates to find the farthest point.
- I then assign the first room and last room as the farthest points.
- I use a math function to calculate the distance between two points.
- I use a for loop to iterate through the list of rooms and compare the midpoint of each room's x, y coordinates to find the farthest point.
- I then assign the first room and last room as the farthest points.
- I use a swap room variable to keep track of the farthest point.
- I also use a room pair variable to store the farthest points.
- I use a for loop to iterate through the list of rooms and compare the midpoint of each room's x, y coordinates to find the farthest point.
- I then assign the first room and last room as the farthest points.
- I use a swap room variable to keep track of the farthest point.
- I also use a roo
