# point_collide

    Purpose

    Point-of-View:
    
    This function is used to test whether a point is a valid location for placing a tower.
    
    It takes in two parameters, x and y, which represent the coordinates of a point on the map.
    It uses the self.map attribute, which is a list of dictionaries, each representing a tile on the map.
    
    The function then uses the self.map[x][y]['t'] field to access the tile at the given coordinates.
    If the tile has a tower (self.map[x][y]['t'] == 1), then the function returns False.
    Otherwise, it returns True.
    
    The function is used in the tower placement system to check whether a tower can be placed at a given point on the map.
    This is done by checking if the tile at the given coordinates has a tower or not.
    
    Parameters:
    - x (int): The x-coordinate of the point on the map.
    - y (int): The y-coordinate of the point on the map.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if the point is a valid location for placing a tower, False otherwise.

    This function is used to test whether a point is a valid location for placing a tower. It is used in the tower placement system to check whether a tower can be placed at a given point on the map.
    
    Parameters:
    - x (int): The x-coordinate of the point on the map.
    - y (int): The y-coordinate of the point on the map.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if the point is a valid location for placing a tower, False otherwise.
    
    The function first checks if the tile at the given coordinates has a tower or not. If it does, it returns False, indicating that placing a tower is not allowed.
    Otherwise, it returns True, indicating that placing a tower is allowed.
