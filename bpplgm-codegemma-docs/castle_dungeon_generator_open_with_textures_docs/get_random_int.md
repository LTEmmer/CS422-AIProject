# get_random_int

    Purpose

    Purpose:
    
    The `get_random_int` function is used to generate a random integer between a low and high value,
    and returns that value.
    Parameters

    Function arguments:
    - **low**: This parameter is a lower bound for the random number to be generated.
    - **high**: This parameter is an upper bound for the random number to be generated.
    
    Function output:
    - **Random integer**: This function returns a random integer between the specified low and high values.

    Code Samples:
    - ```python
        >>> get_random_int(1, 10)
        7
        ```
    - ```python
        >>> get_random_int(100, 200)
        110
        ```
    - ```python
        >>> get_random_int(-10, 10)
        -9
        ```
    
    Function Design:
    ```python
    def get_random_int(low, high):
        """
        Generate and return a random integer between the given low and high values.
        """
        import random

        # Generate a random integer between low and high, inclusive
        random_int = random.randint(low, high)

        return
    Returns

    This function should be used for values where we want a random value between a low and a high number,
    but this function is not designed to accept floats.
    
    `return randint(low, high)`

    :param low: A low value
    :type low: int
    :param high: A high value
    :type high: int
    :return: A random integer between low and high (exclusively)
    :rtype: int
