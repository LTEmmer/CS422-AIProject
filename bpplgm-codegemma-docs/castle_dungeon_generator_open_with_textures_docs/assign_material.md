# assign_material

    Purpose

    The function takes an object (ob) and a material name (mat_name) as input. The function then appends the material with the given name to the list of materials on the object.
    
    
    It is a function that takes an object and a material name as parameters and appends the material with that name to the list of materials on the object.
    
    
    This function is useful for assigning materials to objects in Blender. The object's materials are updated with the material with the given name.
    
    
    
    
    The function iterates through the list of material names and appends the material with the given name to the object's material list.
    
    
    
    This function is used to assign materials to objects in Blender. The materials are updated with the materials with the given names.
