# cleanup_mesh

    Purpose

    This function is used to cleanup the mesh by joining all cube objects into one, selecting the entire mesh, removing overlapping verts, de-selecting everything in edit mode, and switching back into object mode. It also includes comments to explain each step of the code.
    
    The purpose of this function is to perform a series of operations on a mesh to prepare it for modeling, including joining all cubes, selecting the entire mesh, removing overlapping verts, joining all meshes, and switching back into object mode. The code is well structured, easy to read, and includes comments explaining each step of the process.
    
    Overall, this function is a simple tool for cleaning up meshes for modeling by joining all cube objects into one and selecting the entire mesh, removing overlapping verts, joining all meshes, and switching back into object mode. The purpose is to clean up the mesh to make modeling easier and faster.
