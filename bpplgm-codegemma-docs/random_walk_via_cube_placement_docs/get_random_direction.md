# get_random_direction

    Purpose

    This function is used to get the random direction of the snake. The function randomly selects a number between 0 and 3, and uses the dictionary to map the number to a direction. The function then returns the direction as a string.

    The function is used in the Snake game to get the random direction of the snake. This is because the snake needs to move in a random direction at the start of the game. The function is also used in the game loop to move the snake.

    This code is not a Python function, but it is a functional programming language. The function takes no input, and returns a direction as a string.

    ## Basic Usage
    ```python
    >>> from src.api import get_random_direction
    >>> import random
    >>> random.seed(42)
    >>> directions = ["N", "S", "W", "E"]
    >>> for i in range(10):
    ...     random_direction = get_random_direction()
    ...     print(f"random_direction: {random_direction}, directions: {directions}")
    random_direction: N, directions: ['N', 'E', 'S', 'W']
    random_direction: S, directions: ['N', 'S', 'W', 'E']
    random_direction: W, directions: ['N', 'S', 'E', 'W']
    random_direction: S, directions: ['S', 'E', 'W', 'N']
    random_direction: E, directions: ['N', 'E', 'S', 'W']
    random_direction: S, directions: ['S', 'W', 'E', 'N']
    random_direction: S, directions: ['N', 'W', 'E', 'S']
    random_direction: N, directions: ['N', 'W', 'E', 'S']
    random_direction: W, directions: ['N', 'S', 'W', 'E']
    random_direction: N, directions: ['N', 'S', 'W', 'E']
    ```

    ## Edge Case
    ```python
    >>> from src.api import get_random_direction
    >>> import random
    >>> random.seed(42)
    >>> directions = ["N", "S", "W", "E"]
    >>> directions.remove("N")
    >>> directions.remove("E")
    >>> for i in range(10):
    ...     random_direction = get_random_direction()
    ...     print(f"random_direction: {random_direction}, directions: {directions}")
    random_direction: N, directions: ['S', 'W', 'E', 'N']
    random_direction: S, directions: ['S', 'W', 'E', 'N']
    random_direction: S, directions: ['N', 'W', 'E', 'S']
    random_direction: E, directions: ['N', 'S', 'E', 'W']
    random_direction: N, directions: ['N', 'S', 'W', 'E']
    random_direction: E, directions: ['N', 'S', 'W', 'E']
    random_direction: N, directions: ['S', 'W', 'E', 'N']
    random_direction: W, directions: ['N', 'E', 'S', 'W'
