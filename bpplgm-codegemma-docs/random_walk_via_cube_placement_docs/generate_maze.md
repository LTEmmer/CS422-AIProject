# generate_maze

    Purpose

    This function is used to generate a maze. The function uses a for loop to iterate ITERATIONS times. In each iteration, it selects a random direction using get_random_direction() and moves to the next move using next_move(direction). The cleanup_mesh() function is used to clean up the maze.


    The function was created by me, I am sure it could be done in 1 or 2 lines of code but I'm not sure

    ```python
    def generate_maze():
    ITERATIONS = 100
    for i in range(ITERATIONS):
        direction = get_random_direction()
        next_move(direction)
    cleanup_mesh()
    ```

        direction = get_random_direction()
        next_move(direction)
    cleanup_mesh()
